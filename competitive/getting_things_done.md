A shoutout to "High Output Management" – a long forgotten book, which might be the best of them all.

It is the best book on the subject according to a long list of world-famous entrepreneurs (from Steve Jobs to Brian Chesky)

Loved to see this at the top of the list. It is #1. Along those lines, I would actually add "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr. Tons of Andy Grove wisdom in there, distilled and focused in a way that "Hard Thing About Hard Things" isn't. I think MWM fits on this list and HTAHT doesn't, even though I did read and enjoy both.

It looks like you wait until others show you the way. But you have to do the necessary research and thinking yourself. There's no other way.

So read books, extract from them what you think you can use and translate that to your own situation.

What are your goals in life? What do you want to accomplish? What is holding you back? Circumstances? Fears? Lack of knowledge? Once you know that, you can start working on it.

To be honest, any one of the recommend books would've help you start being productive. You can pick one, skim through the action parts, take just one technique and apply it. It's okay you don't have to read everything if you're not feeling very motivated.

4 Thousand Weeks is not a constructive productivity book. It attacks the concept of productivity and incremental personal development.

Claiming it is unhealthy self-perpetuating and dis-satisfying. He has this view because he researched productivity as a career and got little from the experience. That does not mean that others can't benefit from effective time management strategies or mindsets.

He basically asserts that the effort isn't worth it and you should prioritize:

\-Significant Others

\-Family and Children

and

\-Political Causes

It should be called, Why You Shouldn't Try to be More Efficient by Oliver Burkeman.

Can you add a reason why each book is best? Every productivity / self help book I’ve ever read feels identical with different coats of paint so I’ve never found a useful one.

How so, though? How has it helped you? I always see TONS of generic ideas and platitudes around productivity and self help books but I still haven't found one that gives you much else.

I would love to hear more about these books and how people found them helpful. Hearing first hand accounts as opposed to some amazon description / review would be really helpful!

What doesn’t work for you or how do you think it won’t work for you ? I’m also eager to hear your view point.

I have read a few of them from the list and some others on some similar topics. Generally the worse ones that I selected came with a couple of interesting notions and one implementation in my life / routine / mental framework. The most interesting ones really changed many areas of life or perception. The books are generally helpful to push a concept without you having to brain wander about it and therefore not being practical for you. They come with prepackaged concepts properly detailed that you may or may not choose for your life after being introduced it’s benefits and for who it is. These aren’t Bibles though and a selection of what they propose that works for you is mandatory. There is also a lot of tries and fails. GTD method for instance is a fantastic structure and I find it better when tweaked to work for me to overcome some limitations (in creativity I found mainly)

> What doesn’t work for you or how do you think it won’t work for you ?

Not sure, that's why I was asking for opinions. I haven't read any of the books listed above but I've read a bunch of self help and productivity books in the past and I just never found anything helpful as they're always full of either stories where someone gets lucky / has things go right for them, or "lessons" where it almost always boil down to "just do X" or "write down X and then just do it".

So ultimately I have no idea what's really a good book or not. Or, maybe more important, what's a good book _that'll work for me_ (which I'm not sure what that looks like to be honest) so I was hoping for more details about how folks found the books useful.

It's about productivity in general. Productivity of teams, but the concepts are highly applicable elsewhere.

Chapter 1 is about cooking an egg. We're still cooking eggs by Chapter 7, but now with an egg cooking factory. It's about the underlying concepts, not a manual for an egg cooking factory.

One of many many examples: the book argues that there are only 2 reasons for low productivity. It names both reasons and how to cope with them. It's intended for teams, but is highly applicable in personal life and solo work.

Also agreed. That is a very important side of it. Another for me is to avoid selecting a trending book when choosing it which didn’t pass the time filter of crowd recommendation.

But I agree, "The Hard Thing About Hard Things" is also amazing.

I couldn't get through 5am club. I listened to it on audiobook and I just couldn't get past the really contrived story. I'll push High Output Management higher on my list (it's sitting on my shelf right now).

Second that. It takes so much time getting to the main point. Better write a blog if you don't have material to put in for a book.

One of advices Ferris gives in “4 hours workweek” is enter restaurant backdoor, and arrange things with the waiter, to get cheaper meals 😂.

Another one is competing in inferior categories, he’s got some kick boxing medal or something.

I did not read Tools…, but based on his speeches and his famous book, 4 hours…, I’d say he’s full of bullshit.

Nonetheless, if it works for you, that’s great!

> Another one is competing in inferior categories, he’s got some kick boxing medal or something.

From what I heard he competed in Muay Thai (a type of kickboxing) but instead of getting good at kickboxing he found a loophole in the rules and got really good at abusing it (I think it involved rushing people and pushing them out of the ring or something to that effect). Which is at least kind of funny haha.

For me Tools of Titans had way too many recommendations and not enough prioritizing of those recommendations (like alternating going in a sauna and an ice bath for hours every day...). To do everything Tim Ferris recommends you would need 100 hour days.

Haha! I haven’t read that one. Tools is not his words at all but the habits of successful people as stated by them from interviews and organized by topic. Rick Rubin, Jack Dorsey, Peter Thiel, Alexis Ohanian and many many others ranging all areas. So if you want a little boost for fitness you can just open that chapter and have a nicely organized page or two that will motivate. Or for finance etc. writing etc. I keep it behind my desk and if I hit a wall I just read a quick page and get some wind in the sails.

If you listen to Tim Ferriss podcast he gives the impression that he’s almost embarrassed by his 4 Hour book. He’s definitely an unconventional successful author and now I think more famous for his podcast. His interviews are really good, he prepares and really get good material out of most. Sorry I have lots of thoughts on Tim since at one time I attempted to listen to all his podcasts.

He’s a podcaster because he cannot produce anything valuable by himself, so he’s taking value from other valuable people.

The 4 hour work week is to be taken with a grain of salt, and he says as much in the book, but it has some great stuff in it. For most people the take away is, "you're frittering your life away working a 9-5 without leveraging your time somehow". That really blows people's minds sometimes, especially when they're young and stuck in the middle class mindset. Yes, the world would be fucked if everyone followed his advice. But it's sound advice for the lucky few who can make it work.

Most of them are Procrastinating Productivity 😃 (excepting High Output Management).

For instance, Deep Work tells you that you (really) have to do the work, nothing else, duh 😂

Yes! And also you need have a rich life, read widely, and seek an understanding of the latest in psychology. I think a lot of productivity books are written from a psychological normative perspective which is why people who don’t struggle with productivity aren’t interested. Most are common sense and intuitive. Back to Cal, he tries and succeeds at being an ideas guy. Apologize for the free association there.

I think narrowing deep work to that extent is straw manning it. Of course for every book, there is the main theme and the rest of the book revolves around that idea from different angles to strengthen the argument or to showcase how it can be done, To really convey the underlying idea.

The same can be done with any book, but such method of criticism really prevents one’s ability to learn the thinking process behind how the author arrived to the main conclusion. If the book is about (really) having to do the work and nothing else, and that being so self-evident, then why do thousands of people found it to be of great value? There has to be more to it than meets the eye. And I am inviting you to keep an open mind to at least explore that

Instead of Self help books I increased my productivity by reading and implementing practices of different schools of philosophy, especially Stoics, I read the translation of the stoics original works(Marcus Aurelius', Senenca , epictatus , ceno, catho) And I don't think I can increase my productivity any further. I am preparing for JEE , It is considered second hardest entrance exams(I need to be in top 68 out of 1.5 million aspirants to get the best courses) and I think I am definitely one the top contenders. I am being personally mentored by an IPHO(International Physics Olympiad ) gold medalist. He is an MIT graduate in 2 degrees(phy and maths), I started reading these books with him and we make our own interpretations and try my best to use it in my preparation, My fab 2023's total study hour count is 225 rn. I am 16, reading Self-help is not for me, as I don't have much experience in life, and I haven't faced much problems in life. My experience while reading Meditation was just too good of a feeling, It was like Marcus is talking to me and trying to explain me why it is my duty to stand and face problems and choose the options which are the hardest, have better perception of things happening to me and controling my thoughts. I succesfully quit youtube which was a hurdle in my preparation.
