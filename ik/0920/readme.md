Got it â€” youâ€™re aiming for **senior-level ML Ops interview prep**, so Iâ€™ll give you a set of **questions by category** that reflect the depth companies expect at staff/senior levels. These are the kinds of questions that test not just tooling, but systems thinking, tradeoffs, and leadership in scaling ML platforms.

---

## **1. System Design & Architecture**

* Walk me through how youâ€™d design an end-to-end ML platform that supports both batch and real-time inference. What are the tradeoffs?


* How would you design feature stores? When would you use online vs offline stores, and how do you keep them consistent?


* Whatâ€™s your approach for managing multi-tenant ML workloads (e.g., data scientists with different models and libraries) in a Kubernetes environment?



* How would you architect an ML workflow so that it supports reproducibility, lineage tracking, and auditing?
* Explain how youâ€™d support hybrid cloud or on-prem GPU clusters for training at scale.

---

## **2. Model Lifecycle Management**

* How do you track and version models, datasets, and experiments together? What pitfalls have you seen?
* Whatâ€™s your process for rolling back a model in production if metrics degrade unexpectedly?
* How do you handle drift detection â€” both data drift and concept drift â€” and what are the challenges of automating responses?
* How do you manage retraining pipelines for models that need continual updates without overwhelming compute resources?

---

## **3. Deployment & Serving**

* Whatâ€™s the difference between batch, streaming, and online inference pipelines? How do you decide which to use?
* How do you deploy large models (tens of GBs or more) to production with low latency?
* What tradeoffs do you make between gRPC vs REST vs message queue-based serving?
* How would you design canary or shadow deployments for ML models?
* Whatâ€™s your strategy for scaling inference when models are GPU-intensive and demand spikes unpredictably?

---

## **4. Monitoring & Reliability**

* What are the key metrics you monitor for ML systems beyond standard app metrics?
* How do you detect data quality issues before they cascade into model degradation?
* Can you explain how youâ€™d build a monitoring system that ties business KPIs back to model performance?
* How do you ensure explainability and compliance in regulated domains (e.g., finance, healthcare)?

---

## **5. Data & Infrastructure**

* How do you set up pipelines that ensure reproducibility and lineage in a data lake/warehouse context?
* What are the tradeoffs between using Spark, Beam, or Flink for ML data preprocessing?
* How do you handle schema evolution for training and inference pipelines?
* Whatâ€™s your approach to caching/pre-computing embeddings vs generating them on demand?
* Explain how youâ€™d handle large-scale distributed training. When would you choose Horovod, DeepSpeed, or native PyTorch DDP?

---

## **6. Tooling & Ecosystem**

* Compare Kubeflow, MLflow, Metaflow, and Vertex AI/SageMaker. Where do each fall short?
* How would you decide between homegrown MLOps vs adopting a managed platform?
* How do you standardize CI/CD pipelines for ML models compared to software services?
* Whatâ€™s your approach for dependency management when different teams need conflicting CUDA/TensorFlow/PyTorch versions?

---

## **7. Leadership & Strategy**

* How do you balance the tension between researchers wanting flexibility and infra teams pushing for standardization?
* Whatâ€™s your approach to prioritizing MLOps roadmap investments (e.g., monitoring vs feature store vs CI/CD)?
* How do you drive adoption of MLOps best practices across data science and engineering teams?
* Tell me about a time you handled pushback when introducing guardrails (e.g., reproducibility requirements, cost controls).

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to also **draft sample answers for some of these** (in the style of staff-level storytelling), or do you prefer just the question bank for now?
