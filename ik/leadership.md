Influence without authority
- need to know the problem space
- bulding trust and credibility across teams to drive alignment without direct control
- beyond org charts
- building influence through compeling vision and expertisse
- earn leadership through expertise and trust rather than titles
- inspiring diverse teams
  - align engineers, researchers, and designers

Structured communication
- model on how to talk to people
  - standard framework to convey information
    - don't convey complex model and get misinterpreted
    - need clear well defined spec
- dealing with people around the world - text based communication and emails - deliver messages as we can
- communication requires deliberate frameworks and standardized channels to create order amid complexity
- translate technical complexity
  - make it into accessible language tailored to each stakeholder
- documentation that bridges divides
  - well-structured templates eliminate misalignments by minimizing jargon and
    systematically docummenting decisions

Dealing with Ambiguity
- confidently sterring teams through uncertainty and rapidly evolve
- decisive direction-setting
  - effective leaders navigate ambiguity confidently
    - charting courses with incomplete information and
      adapting strategy as new insights emerge
- transparent decision-making
  - clearly articulate decision rationale to all stakeholders
  - maintaining team trust even when outcomes shift

# Stakeholder Orchestration
- coordinating diverse perspective and priorities
- create a cohesive performance rather than disconnected efforts
- master organizational landscape by mapping stakeholders and underlying incentives, define clear roles and responsibilities

# Influence-Authority Matrix
- Executive Sponsor
- Engineering Manager
- ML Researcher
High Influence                    High influence (manage closely)
Low Interest                      High interest


                                  Low power      (keep informed)
                                  High interest

# Building Influence
1. build credibility
   - demonstrate technical understanding with business acumen
1. create networks
   - forge relationships by understanding teams challenges and metrics
   - need to have people vouch for you
1. share vision
   - be in sync with sponsor
   - articulate compelling narratives

# Translating Technical Language
- 15% hallucination -> 1 in 7 research responses contain fabricated information
- 95th percentile latency 3s, p99: 10s for multi-modal inputs > 5MB -> 5% users experience 3+ second delays, driving 28% abandoment and reducing feature DAU by 18%
- 22% performance degradation on non-English inputs, esp. East Asian languages 

# Launch a product
- Careful planning
- keep engineering, product, and business groups aligned throughout development process

# scale question
- three forces
  1. infra readiness - computing power, data pipelines, latency, and reliability
  1. ML Experimentation - may need to iterate
  1. Product Urgency - promised launch date, competitor move, or market opportunity

# tradeoffs
1. need clear prioritization
1. framework
   1. quick win    (high impact/low complexity)
   2. sink hole    (low impact/high complexity)
   3. big project  (high impact/high complexity)
   4. fill-ins     (low impact/low complexity)

# Coordinate execution
1. Daily / Weekly Stand-ups or Syncs
   - keep focused
1. demo days / show and tell
1. model validation checkpoints (lock in place)
   - model freeze
1. async tracking tools
   - shared project tracking tools

# Managing conflict
1. Establish Clear Escalation Paths
   - create protocols for surfacing launch concerns
   - early rather than conceling issues
   - reward risk identification
1. Ask
   - host a  
1. Acknowledge
1. Align
1. Advance
1. How do you define success?
   - how do you know when you are done
   - ux criteria 

Q how do you deal with high ambiguity
1. influencing without escalations
   1. trust currencies align teams with competing priorities
1. iteration and feedback loops
   1. model risk reviews
   1. established a go/no-go criteria
1. Triangle of Tradeoffs - tech debt,speed,responsible AI
1. Influence/Authority Matrix
1. Situation/Task/Action/Result
