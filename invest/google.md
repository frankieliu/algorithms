# Google Match

How It Works

1. How It Works
2. Good to Know

## Your Google Match

When you save in the plan, Google matches your contributions. Learn how to get the most out of your Google match in 2025.

**How to Get the Full Google Match**

Google will match 50% of your contributions up to $23,500, which means the maximum match is $11,750. But if you don’t want to contribute quite that much, Google will match 100% of your pre-tax and Roth contributions up to $3,000.

So at the end of the year, you’ll get the greater of:

- 100% match of your pre-tax and Roth 401(k) contributions up to $3,000, or

- 50% match of your pre-tax and Roth contributions up to $11,750

**Here's How It Works**

- First, Google matches 50% (up to $11,750) of your pre-tax and Roth contributions throughout the year.

- Then, if you have received less than $3,000 in company matching contributions as of December 31, and you’re still employed, Google will make a "true-up" contribution to your plan account in the first quarter of the following year, to help you reach your potential full match of $3,000.

Check out the table below for a few examples.

| Your (Employee) Contribution—Throughout the Year | Google’s Match—Throughout the Year | Google’s True Up Contribution—The Following Year | Total Google Contribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $1,000 | $500  
 | $500  
 | $1,000 |
| $2,000  
 | $1,000  
 | $1,000  
 | $2,000  
 |
| $3,000  
 | $1,500  
 | $1,500  
 | $3,000  
 |
| $4,000  
 | $2,000  
 | $1,000  
 | $3,000 |
| $6,000  
 | $3,000  
 | $0  
 | $3,000 |
| $10,000 | $5,000 | $0 | $5,000 |
| $23,500  
 | $11,500  
 | $0 | $11,750  
 |

These types of contributions are not eligible for the Google match:

- After-tax 401(k)
- Catch-up
- Rollovers
- In-plan Roth conversions

[You can learn how to change your contributions here.](https://ownyourfuture.vanguard.com/content/en/ekit/google/manage-my-money/contributions.html#iig-tabs-a95fa2c85d-tab2)

_Whenever you invest, there's a chance you could lose the money._

## Good to Know

If you still have questions about Google’s match, check out the information below.

### Company match: Pre-tax vs Roth 401(k)

- Google will match the dollar amount that you contribute on a “per pay period” basis for both your pre-tax and Roth money. Your contribution amount, whether you’ve chosen a flat dollar amount or a percentage, is based off your gross salary. It also doesn’t matter whether you choose pre-tax or Roth.
    
    What does matter when you’re deciding between pre-tax and Roth (or a combination of both) is when it’s taken out of your paycheck—either before you pay taxes on any of that money (pre-tax) or after you paid taxes on the money (Roth).
    
- Google's match is always contributed as pre-tax money and won’t be recognized as income that year. You’ll owe taxes on that money—as well as any earnings—when you take it out in retirement.\* It will be taxed as normal income, depending on your tax bracket that year.
    
    For example, if you contribute $23,500 in Roth money this year, Google will match $11,750 in pre-tax money.
    
- Vanguard keeps track of the different contribution types for you. When you retire or leave Google, you can even roll over your money to separate IRA accounts (pre-tax and Roth) to enjoy the flexibility of taking the money out when it makes the most sense for you.\*

### Bonuses and 401(k) contribution

You can choose to contribute an amount from your Bonus that’s different from the amount you’re contributing from your Base pay.

Bonus choices apply to the annual company bonus and quarterly sales bonus only. Sign-on and relocation bonuses are not eligible for your plan contribution. Most other bonus types—such as spot, peer, etc.—are considered Base pay and are subject to the contribution rate for your biweekly paychecks.

You can adjust your bonus pre-tax, bonus Roth, or bonus after-tax 401(k) contribution rates online. [You can learn how to change your contributions here](https://ownyourfuture.vanguard.com/content/en/ekit/google/manage-my-money/contributions.html#iig-tabs-a95fa2c85d-tab2).

### True up contributions

If you have received less than $3,000 in company matching contributions as of December 31, and you’re still employed, Google will make a "true up" contribution to your plan account in the first quarter of the following year to help you reach your potential full match of $3,000.

### Contribution eligibility

- Google’s company match isn’t prorated. You’re immediately eligible to receive the full match no matter when you join Google throughout the year.

- You’re immediately vested in Google’s match. That means as soon as you receive the match, the money belongs to you, regardless of how long you stay with Google.

- You can't contribute more to the Google 401(k) plan than you earn from Google in a given year. For example, if you earn $20,000 at Google, any contributions over $20,000 (which are possible with the Google match) will be returned to you and Google as an excess distribution—or a 415(c) excess, according to the IRS. [You can learn more about excess distributions here](https://ownyourfuture.vanguard.com/content/en/ekit/google/resources/excess.html).

- After-tax and catch-up contributions aren’t eligible for the company match. Neither are rollovers into the Google 401(k) or any in-plan conversions of after-tax contributions to Roth.

**\*Taxes:** Taking money from your retirement account can affect how much you’ll have to pay in taxes. You’ll owe taxes on pre-tax money. You won’t owe taxes on Roth earnings as long as you are age 59½ or older and it’s been at least five years since your first Roth contribution. If required by law, Vanguard will withhold some taxes for you. You may need to pay a 10% federal penalty tax if you take money out early.

How to Make a Change

1.  Overview
2.  How to Make a Change
3.  Good to Know

## Contribution Types

When you save in the Google 401(k) plan, you have choices—like deciding when you want to save on taxes.

**2024 Employee Contribution Limits**

The pre-tax and/or Roth 401(k) contribution limit is $23,000. If you're age 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 for a total of $30,500.

The after-tax 401(k) contribution limit is $34,500.

**2025 Employee Contribution Limits**  
The pre-tax and/or Roth 401(k) contribution limit is $23,500. If you're age 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 for a total of $31,000. If you're ages 60 to 63, or you'll reach age 60 by year's end, you can contribute an extra $11,250 in pre-tax/Roth contributions, for a total of $34,750.

The after-tax 401(k) contribution limit is $34,750.

**You’ll be enrolled automatically**

When you’re enrolled in the plan as a Noogler, we try to make saving as easy as possible by automatically enrolling you with a pre-tax contribution rate of 10%. Then we take it one step further. Once you reach the IRS limit for pre-tax and Roth 401(k) contributions for the year, your contributions will automatically switch to after-tax at a rate of 6%. Those after-tax 401(k) contributions are automatically converted to Roth when you make them.

But you can make different choices. The Google 401(k) plan offers three contribution types: pre-tax, Roth 401(k), and after-tax 401(k). You can even choose a combination of all three. Check out the table below to better understand your options.

**You can choose when to save on taxes**

**Pre-tax contributions** can help you save on your taxes today in anticipation of paying a lower income tax rate in retirement. They’re deducted before taxes, which reduces your current taxable income. And when you take the money out in retirement, they’re taxed at your normal income tax rate at that time. They’re also eligible for Google's match.

**Roth 401(k) contributions** allow you to take care of the taxes today, in case you’re in a higher tax bracket in retirement. They’re made post-tax and don’t reduce your current taxable income. The money comes out tax-free in retirement as long as it’s a qualified distribution.\* And they’re eligible for Google’s match.

**After-tax 401(k) contributions** allow you to save above the contribution limits of pre-tax and Roth money, but they’re not eligible for Google’s match. They’re made post-tax, and they have two tax treatments. The amount you contribute is tax-free, while any growth and earnings are taxed at your normal income tax rate at the time of distribution or Roth conversion. Unless you opt out, your after-tax 401(k) contributions will automatically convert to Roth. That way, the entire amount, including any growth, can be withdrawn tax-free.\*\*\* [**You can learn more about converting to Roth here.**](https://ownyourfuture.vanguard.com/content/en/ekit/google/manage-my-money/roth.html "Roth")

**\*Taxes:** Taking money from your retirement account can affect how much you’ll have to pay in taxes. You’ll owe taxes on pre-tax money. You won’t owe taxes on Roth earnings as long as you are age 59½ or older and it’s been at least five years since your first Roth contribution. If required by law, Vanguard will withhold some taxes for you. You may need to pay a 10% federal penalty tax if you take money out early.

\*\*Contribution limit is a combination of pre-tax and Roth contributions across all employer plans for the year. If you’re age 50 or older, you're eligible to save more through "catch-up" contributions. You could contribute an additional $7,500 (up to $30,500) to your retirement plan in 2024, and you can contribute as much as $7,500 more (up to $31,000) in 2025. As of 2025, if you're ages 60 through 63 on the last day of the calendar year, you can save an additional $3,750 in catch-up contributions (up to $34,750). This is automatically enabled through your normal deductions.

**\*\*\*Taxes:** When you convert pre-tax money to Roth, you’ll owe taxes on the whole amount. When you convert traditional after-tax money, you’ll owe taxes on just the earnings. You should talk with a tax advisor before you do this. Later, when you take the Roth money out, you won’t owe taxes as long as you meet two conditions. First, you’re at least age 59½. Second, you converted the money at least five years earlier. If you take the money out early, you may have to pay income tax and a 10% federal penalty tax. If required by law, Vanguard will withhold some taxes for you.

## How to Change Your Contributions

You can contribute from 1% to 100% of your eligible compensation on a pre-tax, Roth 401(k), or after-tax 401(k) basis—or any combination of these options. Regardless of the type of contribution you make, you can choose to contribute either a percentage of your pay or a fixed dollar amount (at least $10 each paycheck).

Follow these instructions to change your contribution rate (0% to 100%) or set a flat dollar amount for next eligible payroll cycle.

Log in to your account at [vanguard.com/retirementplansOpens in a new tab](https://ownyourfuture.vanguard.com/home/login "vanguard.com/retirementplans").

You should see your Google 401(k) plan account homepage. You may have to click **Employer plans** if you have another Vanguard account.

Click the **Manage my money** tab at the top of the page.

Click **Contributions** followed by **Change my contribution amount**.

Adjust your percentage or dollar amount for your pre-tax, Roth, or after-tax 401(k) contributions.

-   You can choose amounts for your regular pay and your bonus pay.

-   Google only [matches](https://ownyourfuture.vanguard.com/content/en/ekit/google/manage-my-money/match.html "Google match") pre-tax and Roth contributions—not catch-up contributions.

-   Choose what works best for you—a percentage or a flat dollar amount.

-   Each amount you enter will be taken out on a “per pay period” basis.

-   If you elect an amount equal to or more than your paycheck to your 401(k) plan, you’ll receive a paycheck with $0 net pay.

-   If you don’t elect an after-tax 401(k) contribution amount, you can choose to participate in (or opt out of) the automatic change to after-tax 401(k) contributions once you reach your pre-tax and Roth limit.

Click **Continue** and follow the directions until you click the "Submit my changes" button. Please note that a transaction is not complete until you receive the confirmation number.

## Your Top Questions—Answered

If you have additional questions about your plan contributions, check out the list below.

### When will my paycheck deductions take effect?

The cutoff for paycheck deduction changes is typically on Wednesday at 6:00pm PT, in the week prior to a payroll cycle. We encourage you to check out [go/401kcutoffsOpens in a new tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fB24HPn-1-64A9_A9fKjLHR9mRTJbTldGqtrL7b-8hY/view "cutoff") for a full list of cutoff dates. We’re unable to make any exceptions once a cutoff date has passed. Also, we don’t have the ability to retroactively adjust your savings rate.

### What is the hierarchy of contributions?

Your pre-tax, Roth 401(k), and/or after-tax 401(k) contributions are made to the Google 401(k) plan in the following order:

-   Pre-tax 401(k) + Google match—highest priority

-   Roth 401(k) + Google match

-   After-tax 401(k)—lowest priority

-   Loan repayments

It’s important to note that when you are making 401(k) contribution elections, certain factors may affect your contribution amounts before they are deposited into your account. These factors may include compulsory taxes, garnishments, levies, and/or medical deductions, which could take priority in specific situations.  

### Do after-tax 401(k) contributions start automatically?

Once you reach the IRS limit for pre-tax and Roth contributions for the year, your contributions will default to after-tax at a rate of 6%. While there is no way to change this percentage, if any dollar amount or percentage is entered into the after-tax field online, then your after-tax money will be contributed _at the same time_ as your pre-tax and/or Roth contributions.

And unless you opt out, your after-tax 401(k) contributions will automatically convert to Roth when you make them.

You can also choose to opt out of automatic after-tax contributions by contacting Vanguard and making a paycheck deduction change request.

### How do I avoid over-contributing to the plan?

While you’re responsible for making sure your contributions don’t exceed the IRS limits, Google Payroll will not allow you to contribute over the annual IRS limits for each contribution type in the Google 401(k) plan. You only need to track your own contributions if you’re contributing to more than one employer plan.

If you’re a Noogler, you can use the [go/401kcalculatorOpens in a new tab](https://login.corp.google.com/request?s=calculator-401k.googleplex.com:443/uberproxy/&d=https://calculator-401k.googleplex.com/%3Fupxsrf%3DADkZ1PX0bnyWgnUzqg6jjG_G7xYJT0pYJpJrAtI6d5bgF_AJFA:1671656542379&maxAge=1200&authLevel=2000000&keyIds=p2T,ul2,3aq,r4j#Calculator "401k calculator") (from your corporate-issued device) to keep track of your savings so you don’t over-contribute across multiple employer plans in a given year. If you've made contributions to another employer's 401(k) plan this year, use the tool to help you calculate a contribution rate that works best for you.

### How do I avoid a 415(c) excess?

You can't contribute more to the Google 401(k) plan than you earn from Google in a given year. For example, if you earn $20,000 at Google, any contributions over $20,000 (which are possible with the Google match) will be returned to you and Google as an excess distribution—or a 415(c) excess, according to the IRS.

If you want to make an excess distribution, you must have assets available in the core fund lineup. You won't be able to process an excess distribution using brokerage assets.

### What are catch-up contributions?

Catch-up contributions allow you to save above the normal IRS annual limit on a pre-tax or Roth basis. If you are age 50 or older, or will reach age 50 by year’s end, _and_ you contribute the maximum allowed, you are eligible to make catch-up contributions. If you are ages 60 to 63, or will reach ages 60 to 63 by year’s end, you may be able to make additional catch-up contributions.

If you’re eligible, you’ll automatically start making catch-up contributions unless you actively elect to stop them once you reach the limit.

**Important**: Catch-up contributions don’t qualify for company matching contributions.

### What happens if I receive more than one paycheck during a pay period?

Flat dollar elections will only be taken out once during that pay period. Percentage elections will be deducted from your total eligible pay during that pay period.

### Can I contribute my bonus?

Yes. However, your contribution election for **Bonus pay** contributions at Vanguard will only be applied to any annual company bonuses and quarterly sales bonuses. Sign-on and relocation bonuses are not eligible for 401(k) contributions. All other eligible bonus types—such as spot, peer, fixed-term staffing incentive, and fixed-term source incentive—will have your **Base pay** deferral rate applied. Please make sure you make your elections accordingly. Contact [go/payroll-supportOpens in a new tab](https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth/identifier?client_id=761377308534.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.corp.google.com%2Foauth&response_type=code&scope=openid%20email&state=s%3Dgoto2.corp.google.com%3A443%2Fuberproxy%2F%26d%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fgoto2.corp.google.com%2Fpayroll-support%3Fupxsrf%253DAO9zFu0aASwpG6O6MUz6oTOOwhLP0AqxQRg_lgN6q3pHgjx1lw%3A1666721782285%26keyIds%3Dp2T%2Cul2%2C3aq%2Cr4j%26maxAge%3D1200%26authLevel%3D1500%26ssoformat%3DCORP_SSO%26x%3DAB-TUMk7YH1PXvQKpEw7cX-l_wKc5vdEVUAYCRb2YZWLxNxY_Q%3A1666721782551&hd=google.com&cred_ref=true&flowName=GeneralOAuthFlow) if you’re not sure how your bonus will be treated.

### How do I set my contribution elections to max out multiple contribution types?

If your goal is to use 100% of your pay to max out multiple contribution types (such as pre-tax and after-tax), we encourage you to enter the annual IRS contribution limit as a dollar amount in each of the contribution types you want to max out. The system will not allow you to elect more than 100% in total.

### Can I contribute 100% of my paycheck to my plan?

If you elect to contribute 100% of your paycheck, Payroll is still required to withhold a portion of your taxable wages for Social Security, Medicare, and/or State Disability Insurance (SDI). If you contribute your entire paycheck to your 401(k), there would be nothing left to cover those withholdings. Since a negative payment can’t be issued, a portion of your paycheck won't be included in your 401(k) contribution to cover those three taxes. When this happens, the portion that’s not going into the 401(k) will be taxable on the state and federal level. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

**If you have loan repayment deductions** and your paycheck is not enough to cover your deductions and your full loan payment, your loan payment will not be deducted. You should adjust your contributions to allow enough of your paycheck to cover the loan payment. If loan payments are missed, they can be made up by making a manual payment online. [Check out the Loans section](https://ownyourfuture.vanguard.com/content/en/ekit/google/access-my-money/loans.html#iig-tabs-bf845fea7b-tab2 "loans") to learn more about how to make a manual loan payment.
