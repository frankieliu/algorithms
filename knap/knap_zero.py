"""
There are

$n$ distinct items and a knapsack of capacity
$W$. Each item has 2 attributes, weight (
$w_{i}$) and value ($v_{i}$).

You have to select a subset of items to put into
the knapsack such that the total weight does not
exceed the capacity $W$â€Š and the total value is
maximized.

              up to element i

    dp[i+1, c] = max(dp[i, c-w] + v, dp[i, c])

    You either take the element or not

    We drop i, and just consider getting the i+1 for i
    without clobbering information.
