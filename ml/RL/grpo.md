**GRPO (Generalized Preference Optimization)** is a recently proposed method that **generalizes** both **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** and **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** under a unified framework.

Letâ€™s unpack what the GRPO **loss function** is and how it relates to DPO and RLHF.

## ðŸ§  What is GRPO?

GRPO treats preference optimization as a form of **importance-weighted policy learning** that doesn't require a reward model or explicit advantage function. It tries to **directly match** the policy to human preferences using a **log-likelihood ratio** approach â€” like DPO â€” but allows for more **flexibility in how preferences are interpreted**.

## ðŸ”£ GRPO Loss Function

Given:

* A prompt $x$
* A preferred (positive) response $y^+$
* A less preferred (negative) response $y^-$
* A reference model $\pi_{\text{ref}}$
* The current policy $\pi_\theta$ (which we are training)
* A **scoring function** $h(x, y^+, y^-)$ that defines preference strength (can be learned or derived from data)

The **GRPO loss** is:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{GRPO}} = -\mathbb{E}_{(x, y^+, y^-)} \left[ \log \sigma \left( h(x, y^+, y^-) \cdot \left( \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y^+|x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y^+|x)} - \log \frac{\pi_\theta(y^-|x)}{\pi_{\text{ref}}(y^-|x)} \right) \right) \right]
$$

Where:

* $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function.
* $h(x, y^+, y^-)$ is a **general preference strength**, e.g. 1 for binary preferences or a continuous value from a reward model.
* If $h = \beta$ (a constant), this reduces to **DPO**.

---

## ðŸ”„ Special Cases

* **GRPO = DPO** if $h(x, y^+, y^-) = \beta$ (constant).
* **GRPO = PPO-style** if $h(x, y^+, y^-) = \hat{A}$ (i.e., advantage estimated from reward differences).

This makes GRPO a **flexible family** of preference optimization algorithms.

## ðŸ§© Intuition

GRPO says: *If humans preferred $y^+$ to $y^-$, then the model should increase the relative likelihood of $y^+$ compared to $y^-$, with a strength depending on how strong that preference is*.
