Yes, **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)** is **a type of fine-tuning**, but it's distinct from traditional supervised fine-tuning. Here's a breakdown of how it works and how positive and negative feedback are incorporated:

---

### ‚úÖ **Is RLHF a type of fine-tuning?**

Yes, but with important differences:

* **Traditional fine-tuning**: Trains a model using supervised learning on labeled input-output pairs (e.g., question ‚Üí correct answer).
* **RLHF**: First involves **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**, then applies **reinforcement learning** using a **reward model** derived from human preferences.

### üß† RLHF Pipeline in 3 Stages

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**:

   * Start with a pretrained language model (e.g., GPT).
   * Collect a dataset of prompts and ideal completions (written or rated by humans).
   * Train the model on this dataset with supervised learning.
   * This gives an SFT model that‚Äôs helpful but still imperfect.

2. **Reward Model (RM) Training**:

   * Collect multiple completions for a prompt (e.g., 2 responses).
   * Humans rank the responses (e.g., response A is better than B).
   * Train a **reward model** to predict a scalar score from a response so that **better responses get higher scores**.
   * The RM learns from **pairwise comparisons**, not absolute labels.

3. **Reinforcement Learning (PPO or similar)**:

   * Generate responses using the SFT model.
   * Use the **reward model** to score them.
   * Apply **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to adjust the model‚Äôs weights:

     * If the reward is **positive**, increase the probability of the output.
     * If the reward is **negative**, decrease the probability.
     * This is done via **policy gradients**, optimizing the expected reward.

### üßÆ How is positive/negative feedback ‚Äúfed in‚Äù?

In PPO, the **loss function** is roughly:

$$
L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_t \left[ \min \left( r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) \hat{A}_t \right) \right]
$$

Where:

* $r_t(\theta) = \frac{\pi_\theta(a_t|s_t)}{\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}}(a_t|s_t)}$ is the **ratio** of new to old policy probabilities.
* $\hat{A}_t$ is the **advantage**: how much better the action was than expected.

  * Positive ‚Üí Encourage (increase probability)
  * Negative ‚Üí Discourage (decrease probability)

The reward model provides a scalar value for the whole sequence, and the advantage is computed using that reward (plus possibly a value function baseline).
