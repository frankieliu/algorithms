### **BLEU Score (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**
The **BLEU score** is a metric used to evaluate the quality of machine-generated translations by comparing them to one or more human reference translations. It measures the **n-gram overlap** between the machine output and the reference texts, providing a score between **0** (worst) and **1** (best), often expressed as a percentage (e.g., 0.75 → 75%).

## **How BLEU is Calculated**
1. **Precision of N-grams**  
   - Compares **1-gram (unigram), 2-gram (bigram), 3-gram, and 4-gram** matches between the candidate and reference translations.  
   - Example:
     - **Reference**: "The cat is on the mat."  
     - **Candidate**: "The cat sits on the mat."  
     - **Matching 1-grams**: "The", "cat", "on", "the", "mat" (5/6 words).  
     - **Matching 2-grams**: "The cat", "on the", "the mat" (3/5 bigrams).  

2. **Brevity Penalty (BP)**  
   - Penalizes overly short translations (which could artificially inflate precision).  
   - If the candidate length (**c**) < reference length (**r**), BP = \( e^{(1 - r/c)} \).  

3. **Final BLEU Formula**  
   \[
   \text{BLEU} = BP \cdot \exp\left( \sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n \log p_n \right)
   \]
   - \( p_n \) = precision for n-grams.  
   - \( w_n \) = weights (usually uniform: 0.25 for 1- to 4-grams).

## **Example Calculation**
| **Reference** | "The cat is on the mat." |  
| **Candidate** | "The cat sits on the mat." |  

1. **1-gram Precision**: 5/6 = 0.833  
2. **2-gram Precision**: 3/5 = 0.6  
3. **Brevity Penalty**: Candidate (6) = Reference (6) → BP = 1  
4. **BLEU (N=2)** = \( 1 \cdot \exp(0.5 \cdot \log(0.833) + 0.5 \cdot \log(0.6)) \approx 0.71 \)

## **Why Use BLEU?**
✅ **Standard in MT**: Widely used in machine translation (MT) research (e.g., Google Translate, OpenAI).  
✅ **Fast & Automatic**: No human evaluators needed.  
✅ **Multi-Reference Support**: Works with multiple reference translations.  

---

## **Limitations of BLEU**
❌ **No Semantic Understanding**: Only checks surface-level n-gram matches.  
❌ **Poor for Fluency**: A high BLEU score doesn’t guarantee grammatical correctness.  
❌ **Biased Toward Short Sentences**: Brevity Penalty helps but doesn’t fully fix the issue.  
❌ **Language-Dependent**: Works better for languages with rigid word order (e.g., English vs. Latin).

## **BLEU Score Ranges**
| Score Range | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| **< 30**    | Poor (little meaning preserved) |
| **30–50**   | Understandable but flawed |
| **50–70**   | Good quality (human-like in parts) |
| **70+**     | Very high (near-human) |

- **Human Translation**: Typically scores **60–80+** depending on the task.  
- **SOTA Models (2024)**:  
  - **WMT English-German**: ~40–50 BLEU (neural models).  
  - **Google’s T5**: ~30–60 depending on the dataset.

## **Tools to Compute BLEU**
### **Python (NLTK, SacreBLEU)**
```python
from nltk.translate.bleu_score import sentence_bleu
reference = [["The", "cat", "is", "on", "the", "mat"]]
candidate = ["The", "cat", "sits", "on", "the", "mat"]
score = sentence_bleu(reference, candidate, weights=(0.5, 0.5))  # BLEU-2
print(score)  # Output: ~0.71
```
- **SacreBLEU** (Standardized BLEU):  
  ```bash
  pip install sacrebleu
  echo "The cat sits on the mat" > cand.txt
  echo "The cat is on the mat" > ref.txt
  sacrebleu ref.txt -i cand.txt -m bleu
  ```

## **Alternatives to BLEU**
| Metric       | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **METEOR**   | Considers synonyms and stemming. |
| **TER** (Translation Edit Rate) | Measures edit distance (like WER). |
| **BERTScore** | Uses BERT embeddings for semantic similarity. |
| **COMET**    | Neural metric trained on human judgments. |

- **Quick Checks**: Fast way to compare models.  
- **Combined with Human Eval**: Best used alongside human judgment.

Speech translation (ST) systems often have lower **BLEU scores** compared to text-based machine translation (MT) due to several inherent challenges in processing spoken language. Here are the key reasons:

---

### **1. Noisy Input: ASR Errors Propagate to Translation**
- Speech recognition (**ASR**) isn’t perfect, especially with accents, background noise, or spontaneous speech.
- **Example**:  
  - **Spoken utterance**: *"I wanna go to the park."*  
  - **ASR output**: *"I want to go to the park."* (minor error)  
  - **Translation**: Correct, but BLEU drops due to mismatched n-grams.  
- **Impact**: Even small ASR errors (e.g., "wanna" → "want to") reduce BLEU, even if meaning is preserved.

---

### **2. Disfluencies in Spoken Language**
- Speech contains **fillers**, **repetitions**, and **self-corrections** that don’t exist in written text.  
  - **Example**:  
    - **Speech**: *"Uh, I mean, the meeting is, like, at 3 PM?"*  
    - **Written reference**: *"The meeting is at 3 PM."*  
  - **BLEU Penalty**: The extra words ("uh", "like") introduce "insertions," lowering precision.

---

### **3. Lack of Punctuation/Capitalization**
- ASR often outputs **unpunctuated, lowercase text**, while references use proper formatting.  
  - **Example**:  
    - **ASR**: *"the meeting is at three pm"*  
    - **Reference**: *"The meeting is at 3 PM."*  
  - **BLEU Drop**: Mismatched tokens ("three" vs. "3", "pm" vs. "PM") hurt n-gram matches.

---

### **4. Paraphrasing in References**
- Human translators **rephrase spoken language** for fluency, but BLEU penalizes this.  
  - **Example**:  
    - **Speech**: *"It’s, you know, kinda cold outside."*  
    - **Reference**: *"The weather is quite cold."*  
  - **BLEU Issue**: No n-gram overlap, despite correct meaning.

---

### **5. Domain Mismatch**
- Speech translation often handles **casual conversations** (e.g., dialogues, interviews), while BLEU is optimized for **formal text** (e.g., news, Wikipedia).  
  - **Result**: Informal speech rarely matches the "clean" references used in BLEU calculations.

---

### **6. Challenges in Evaluation Metrics**
- **BLEU’s Limitations**:  
  - Doesn’t account for **semantic equivalence** (e.g., "hi" vs. "hello" → 0% match).  
  - Favors **literal translations** over natural ones.  
- **Alternatives**:  
  - **METEOR**: Better with synonyms (*"quick" → "fast"*).  
  - **BERTScore**: Measures semantic similarity using embeddings.  

---

### **Real-World BLEU Scores in Speech Translation**
| Task                          | Typical BLEU Range | Reason for Low Score |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Europarl-ST (English-German)** | ~20–30            | ASR errors + formal rephrasing |
| **TED Talks (En→Fr)**         | ~25–35            | Spontaneous speech + disfluencies |
| **Conversational Speech**     | <20               | High paraphrasing, noise |

---

### **How to Improve Evaluation?**
1. **Use ASR-robust metrics**:  
   - **chrf3**: Accounts for character-level matches (better for noisy text).  
   - **TER (Translation Edit Rate)**: Measures edits needed to match the reference.  
2. **Post-process ASR output**:  
   - Remove fillers ("uh", "um"), normalize numbers ("three" → "3").  
3. **Multi-reference BLEU**:  
   - Compare against multiple human translations to capture variability.  

---

### **Key Takeaway**
BLEU is **not ideal for speech translation** because it was designed for written text. Lower scores don’t always mean worse quality—just a mismatch between spoken language and BLEU’s assumptions. For better assessment, combine BLEU with **human evaluation** or **semantic metrics** (e.g., BERTScore).
