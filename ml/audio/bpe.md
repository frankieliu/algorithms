Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) is a **subword tokenization algorithm** widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to split words into smaller, meaningful units (subwords). It helps handle rare or out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words by breaking them into known subword components.

### **How BPE Works**
1. **Initialize Vocabulary**:  
   - Start with a base vocabulary of individual characters (e.g., letters, punctuation).  
   - For example: `{"a", "b", ..., "z", ".", "!"}`.

2. **Count Word Frequencies**:  
   - Analyze a training corpus and count how often each word appears.  
   - Example corpus: `"low", "lower", "newest", "widest"`.

3. **Split Words into Characters**:  
   - Represent each word as a sequence of characters with a special end token (e.g., `</w>`).  
   - Example: `"low" → "l o w </w>"`.

4. **Merge Most Frequent Pairs**:  
   - Find the most frequent adjacent symbol pairs and merge them into a new symbol.  
   - Example: If `"e" + "s"` is frequent (as in `"newest"` and `"widest"`), merge them into `"es"`.

5. **Repeat Until Desired Vocabulary Size**:  
   - Continue merging pairs until reaching a predefined vocabulary size or no more merges are possible.

### **Example**
- **Initial Vocabulary**: `{l, o, w, e, r, n, s, t, i, d, </w>}`  
- **Step 1**: Merge `e + s → es` (since "es" is frequent).  
- **Step 2**: Merge `es + t → est`.  
- **Final Vocabulary**: May include subwords like `est`, `low`, `er`, etc.

### **Why Use BPE?**
- **Handles Rare Words**: Splits unknown words into known subwords (e.g., "unhappiness" → `un + happy + ness`).  
- **Balances Vocabulary Size**: Avoids a huge vocabulary (like word-level tokenization) while being more efficient than character-level.  
- **Used in Modern NLP**: BPE is the basis for tokenizers in models like **GPT, BERT, and T5**.

### **BPE vs. Other Tokenization Methods**
| Method          | Pros                          | Cons                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Word-Level**  | Simple, preserves meaning    | Fails on OOV words            |
| **Char-Level**  | Handles any word              | Long sequences, less efficient|
| **BPE**         | Balances efficiency & OOV     | Requires training on data     |

### **Implementations**
- **OpenAI’s GPT**: Uses BPE for tokenization.  
- **Hugging Face Tokenizers**: Provides fast BPE implementations.  
- **SentencePiece**: Google’s subword tokenizer (BPE variant).
