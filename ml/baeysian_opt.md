explain the acquisition function for Bayesian hyperparameter optimization

In Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, the **acquisition function** is a critical component that determines which set of hyperparameters to evaluate next. It acts as a guide, directing the search for the optimal hyperparameters by balancing **exploration** and **exploitation**.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### 1\. The Role of Exploration vs. Exploitation

*   **Exploitation** focuses on sampling hyperparameters in regions of the search space that are already known to have performed well. This means the algorithm is trying to "improve" upon the best results found so far.
    
*   **Exploration** involves sampling hyperparameters in new, uncertain regions of the search space. The goal is to discover new, potentially better, solutions that might exist outside the current best-performing areas.
    

The acquisition function uses the probabilistic model (typically a Gaussian Process) to quantify these two trade-offs. The model provides both a predicted mean performance for a given hyperparameter combination and an uncertainty (variance) around that prediction.

### 2\. Common Types of Acquisition Functions

There are several types of acquisition functions, each with a different strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation.

*   **Expected Improvement (EI):** This is one of the most common acquisition functions. It quantifies the _expected_ amount of improvement a new hyperparameter configuration will yield over the current best-observed performance. It balances exploitation (by focusing on areas with a high mean prediction) and exploration (by also considering areas with high uncertainty).
    
*   **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB):** UCB is a simpler acquisition function that selects the next point based on a weighted sum of its predicted mean and its uncertainty. The formula is often written as:
    
     $UCB\left(x\right)=mu\left(x\right)+betasigma\left(x\right)$ 
    
    where  $mu\left(x\right)$  is the predicted mean,  $sigma\left(x\right)$  is the standard deviation (uncertainty), and  $beta$  is a hyperparameter that controls the exploration-exploitation trade-off. A larger  $beta$  encourages more exploration by giving more weight to the uncertainty term.
    
*   **Probability of Improvement (PI):** This function focuses on the probability that a new point will improve upon the current best result. However, it doesn't consider the _magnitude_ of the potential improvement, which can sometimes lead to very small, but certain, improvements being favored over potentially large but uncertain ones.

### 3\. The Optimization Loop

The acquisition function is a key part of the iterative Bayesian optimization process:

1.  **Initialize:** Start with an initial set of hyperparameter configurations and their performance scores.
    
2.  **Build a Surrogate Model:** Use the collected data to build a probabilistic model (e.g., a Gaussian Process) of the objective function. This model estimates the performance and uncertainty for unobserved hyperparameters.
    
3.  **Optimize the Acquisition Function:** Find the hyperparameter combination that maximizes the acquisition function. This is a much cheaper optimization problem than evaluating the actual objective function.
    
4.  **Evaluate:** Run the machine learning model with the new, selected hyperparameters and get its actual performance score.
    
5.  **Update:** Add this new data point (hyperparameters and score) to the set of observations and repeat the process from step 2.
    

This loop continues for a set number of iterations, allowing the algorithm to efficiently find optimal hyperparameters by intelligently exploring the search space.

The video below explains the core concepts of Bayesian optimization, including the roles of the surrogate model and acquisition functions.

You asked:
----------

can you write the formula for bayesian optimization for the "mean" function and the "std dev" function

---

Gemini Replied:
---------------

There isn't a single "mean" or "std dev" function for Bayesian optimization itself. Instead, the **surrogate model**, typically a Gaussian Process (GP), provides the mean ( $mu$ ) and standard deviation ( $sigma$ ) predictions for the objective function. These are not static formulas but are derived from the training data and the GP model's properties.

The key formulas related to this are within the **Gaussian Process** itself.

### Mean Function ( $mu\left(x\right)$ )

The predictive mean,  $mu\left(x\right)$ , is the GP's estimate of the objective function's value at a new, unevaluated point  $x$ . It's a weighted average of the observed function values, where the weights are determined by the kernel function.

For a new point  $x$ , the predictive mean is calculated as:

$$
\mu \left(x\right)=k_{\ast }\left(x\right)^{T}K_{y−1}y
$$

where:

*   $\\\\mathbf{k}\\\_\\\*(x)$ is the vector of kernel covariances between the new point  $x$  and all the previously evaluated points  $X$ .
    
*    $mathbfK_y^{−1}$  is the inverse of the kernel matrix for all the previously evaluated points, including any observation noise.
    
*    $mathbfy$  is the vector of the objective function values (e.g., accuracy scores) for all the previously evaluated points.
    

<br>

* * *

<br>

### Standard Deviation Function ( $sigma\left(x\right)$ )

The predictive standard deviation,  $sigma\left(x\right)$ , represents the uncertainty in the GP's prediction at the new point  $x$ . It's highest in regions far from any previously evaluated points and lowest near observed points.

The predictive variance,  $sigma^{2}\left(x\right)$ , is calculated as:

$$
\sigma ^{2}\left(x\right)=k\left(x,x\right)−k_{\ast }\left(x\right)^{T}K_{y−1}k_{\ast }\left(x\right)
$$

where:

*    $k\left(x,x\right)$  is the kernel function evaluated with the new point  $x$  against itself (the "self-covariance").
    
*   $\\\\mathbf{k}\\\_\\\*(x)$ and  $mathbfK_y^{−1}$  are the same as defined for the mean function.
    

The standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance:

$$
\sigma \left(x\right)=\sqrt{\sigma ^{2}\left(x\right)}
$$

These formulas are what the acquisition function uses to balance exploitation (guided by  $mu\left(x\right)$ ) and exploration (guided by  $sigma\left(x\right)$ ). The mean and standard deviation are not fixed functions, but are dynamically updated in each iteration as more data points are added to the GP model.

can you write the formula for EI

The formula for the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function is used to calculate the expected gain from evaluating a new hyperparameter configuration.

### Expected Improvement (EI) Formula

The formula is: $$EI(\\mathbf{x}) = \\begin{cases} (\\mu(\\mathbf{x}) - f(\\mathbf{x}^+) - \\xi) \\Phi(Z) + \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}) \\phi(Z) & \\text{if } \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}) > 0 \\ 0 & \\text{if } \\sigma(\\mathbf{x}) = 0 \\end{cases}$$where:

$$
Z=\frac{\mu \left(x\right)−f\left(x^{+}\right)−\xi }{\sigma \left(x\right)}
$$

* * *

### Explanation of the Terms

*    $EI\left(x\right)$ : The **Expected Improvement** at a new, unevaluated point  $x$ . This is the value we want to maximize to select the next hyperparameter configuration.
    
*    $\mu \left(x\right)$ : The **predicted mean** of the objective function at point  $x$ , provided by the Gaussian Process surrogate model.
    
*    $\sigma \left(x\right)$ : The **predicted standard deviation** (uncertainty) of the objective function at point  $x$ , also from the Gaussian Process.
    
*    $f\left(x^{+}\right)$ : The **best observed function value** so far. This is the highest score found among all previously evaluated hyperparameter configurations.
    
*    $\Phi \left(Z\right)$ : The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** of the standard normal distribution, evaluated at  $Z$ . This represents the probability of improvement.
    
*    $\varphi \left(Z\right)$ : The **probability density function (PDF)** of the standard normal distribution, evaluated at  $Z$ . This accounts for the magnitude of the potential improvement.
    
*    $\xi$  (xi): An optional **trade-off parameter** (often set to a small positive value like 0.01). It controls the balance between exploration and exploitation. A larger  $\xi$  encourages more exploration by making the algorithm more tolerant of smaller expected improvements.
    

The formula effectively combines the predicted performance ( $\mu \left(x\right)$ ) with the uncertainty ( $\sigma \left(x\right)$ ) to quantify the expected gain from a new evaluation. The first term,  $\left(\mu \left(x\right)−f\left(x^{+}\right)−\xi \right)\Phi \left(Z\right)$ , accounts for exploitation, while the second term,  $\sigma \left(x\right)\varphi \left(Z\right)$ , accounts for exploration.

I apologize for the rendering issue. It seems there was a problem with the display of the LaTeX. Here is the formula for Expected Improvement (EI) again, this time with a clear breakdown and without the formatting that caused the previous error.

### Expected Improvement (EI) Formula

The formula for the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function is used to calculate the expected gain from evaluating a new hyperparameter configuration.

$$EI(\mathbf{x}) = (\mu(\mathbf{x}) - f(\mathbf{x}^+) - \xi) \Phi(Z) + \sigma(\mathbf{x}) \phi(Z)$$

where:

$$
Z=\frac{\mu \left(x\right)−f\left(x^{+}\right)−\xi }{\sigma \left(x\right)}
$$

### Explanation of the Terms

*    $EI\left(x\right)$ : The **Expected Improvement** at a new, unevaluated point  $x$ .
    
*    $\mu \left(x\right)$ : The **predicted mean** of the objective function at point  $x$ , provided by the Gaussian Process surrogate model.
    
*    $\sigma \left(x\right)$ : The **predicted standard deviation** (uncertainty) of the objective function at point  $x$ , also from the Gaussian Process.
    
*    $f\left(x^{+}\right)$ : The **best observed function value** so far.
    
*    $\Phi \left(Z\right)$ : The **cumulative distribution function (CDF)** of the standard normal distribution, evaluated at  $Z$ .
    
*    $\varphi \left(Z\right)$ : The **probability density function (PDF)** of the standard normal distribution, evaluated at  $Z$ .
    
*    $\xi$  (xi): An optional **trade-off parameter** (often a small positive value like 0.01) that controls the balance between exploration and exploitation.

MLE cost function for LR where 
obserations have different variances

Ranjana Rajendran 12:19 PM 
We have checked with Instructor Arjun Sharma and the response we have received 

To answer this question, you will have to derive the loss function in linear regression from a probabilistic perspective. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression section titled  "Maximum-likelihood estimation and related techniques" for reference of discussion below.

In the derivation in that section, each dependent variable (prediction) y_i ~ N(beta * x_i, sigma), that is, each y_i is assumed to follow a normal distribution with mean given by beta * x_i and fixed standard deviation sigma. However, our question states that for each observation i, the standard deviation is different. So we can assume that y_i ~ N(beta * x_i, sigma_i) and sigma_i is given for each observation i.

Then, the derivation would follow just as it does in the wikipedia article, except the final loss will be a "weighted" mean squared error

L = arg min_beta sum_i (1/2 * (sigma_i)^2) * (y_i - beta * x_i)^2
