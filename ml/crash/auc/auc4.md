### **Derivation of the Mann-Whitney U Test and Its Connection to AUC**

The **Mann-Whitney U test** is a non-parametric statistical test used to determine if two independent samples come from the same distribution. It is closely related to the **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)** in machine learning, where AUC measures how well a model ranks positive instances above negative ones.

---

## **1. Intuition Behind the Mann-Whitney U Test**
- **Goal**: Compare two groups (e.g., positive and negative samples) to see if one tends to have higher values than the other.
- **Key Idea**: Instead of comparing means (like a t-test), it compares **rankings** (making it robust to outliers and non-normal distributions).

---

## **2. Step-by-Step Derivation**
### **Given:**
- **Group 1 (Positives)**: \( n_1 \) samples (e.g., \( y = 1 \))
- **Group 2 (Negatives)**: \( n_2 \) samples (e.g., \( y = 0 \))
- **Combined Data**: All \( n_1 + n_2 \) samples ranked from smallest to largest.

### **Step 1: Rank All Samples**
- Assign ranks from **1 (smallest)** to \( n_1 + n_2 \) **(largest)**.
- If values are tied, assign the **average rank**.

**Example**:
| Sample | Group | Value | Rank |
|--------|-------|-------|------|
| A      | 0     | 1.2   | 1    |
| B      | 1     | 1.5   | 2    |
| C      | 0     | 1.7   | 3    |
| D      | 1     | 1.7   | 3    | *(tied with C)* |
| E      | 1     | 2.0   | 5    |

- **Tied values (1.7)** get average rank: \((3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5\).

### **Step 2: Sum Ranks for Each Group**
- \( R_1 \) = Sum of ranks for Group 1 (Positives)
- \( R_2 \) = Sum of ranks for Group 2 (Negatives)

**Example**:
- \( R_1 = 2 + 3.5 + 5 = 10.5 \)
- \( R_2 = 1 + 3.5 = 4.5 \)

### **Step 3: Compute U Statistic**
The **U statistic** counts how many times a value from **Group 1** is greater than a value from **Group 2**.

It can be computed in two ways:
1. **Direct Counting Approach**:
   \[
   U_1 = \text{Number of pairs where } \text{Group 1} > \text{Group 2}
   \]
   (This is computationally expensive for large datasets.)

2. **Rank-Sum Approach** (More Efficient):
   \[
   U_1 = R_1 - \frac{n_1(n_1 + 1)}{2}
   \]
   \[
   U_2 = R_2 - \frac{n_2(n_2 + 1)}{2}
   \]
   - \( U_1 + U_2 = n_1 n_2 \) (always true)

**Example**:
- \( U_1 = 10.5 - \frac{3 \times 4}{2} = 10.5 - 6 = 4.5 \)
- \( U_2 = 4.5 - \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = 4.5 - 3 = 1.5 \)
- Check: \( U_1 + U_2 = 4.5 + 1.5 = 6 = 3 \times 2 \) âœ“

### **Step 4: Connection to AUC**
- The **AUC** is the probability that a random positive sample ranks higher than a random negative sample.
- It can be computed as:
  \[
  \text{AUC} = \frac{U_1}{n_1 n_2}
  \]
- **Example**:
  \[
  \text{AUC} = \frac{4.5}{6} = 0.75
  \]

---

## **3. Why Does This Work?**
### **Interpretation of U**
- \( U_1 \) counts the number of "wins" where a positive sample outranks a negative one.
- If **all positives rank higher than negatives**, then:
  - \( U_1 = n_1 n_2 \) (max possible) â†’ \(\text{AUC} = 1.0\).
- If **rankings are random**, then:
  - \( U_1 \approx \frac{n_1 n_2}{2} \) â†’ \(\text{AUC} = 0.5\).

### **Mathematical Justification**
- The rank-sum formula adjusts for the **minimum possible sum of ranks**:
  \[
  \text{Min}(R_1) = 1 + 2 + \dots + n_1 = \frac{n_1(n_1 + 1)}{2}
  \]
- So, \( U_1 = R_1 - \text{Min}(R_1) \) measures **how much better** Group 1 ranks than random.

---

## **4. Final AUC Formula**
\[
\boxed{\text{AUC} = \frac{R_1 - \frac{n_1(n_1 + 1)}{2}}{n_1 n_2}}
\]
where:
- \( R_1 \) = Sum of ranks of positive samples,
- \( n_1 \) = Number of positive samples,
- \( n_2 \) = Number of negative samples.

---

## **5. Summary**
- The **Mann-Whitney U test** compares two groups by ranking all samples.
- **AUC** is derived from the U statistic, representing the probability that a random positive ranks above a random negative.
- The formula efficiently computes AUC using ranks, handling ties properly.

This is why the **vanilla Python AUC implementation** uses rank sums and the Mann-Whitney U formula! ðŸš€
