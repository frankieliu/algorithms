### **Derivation of the Minimum Possible Rank Sum (Min(R‚ÇÅ))**

To understand why the minimum rank sum for group 1 (positives) is:

\[
\text{Min}(R_1) = \frac{n_1(n_1 + 1)}{2}
\]

we need to examine how ranks are assigned and summed.

---

## **1. Ranking Basics**
- When we combine two groups and rank all samples **from smallest to largest**, ranks are assigned as:
  - **1** (smallest value) ‚Üí **2** ‚Üí **3** ‚Üí ... ‚Üí **N** (largest value), where \( N = n_1 + n_2 \).

- If **all positive samples (group 1) have the smallest values**, they will occupy the **first \( n_1 \) ranks**:
  - Rank **1**, rank **2**, ..., rank **\( n_1 \)**.

---

## **2. Calculating Min(R‚ÇÅ)**
If **all positives are ranked lowest** (worst-case scenario for AUC), their ranks are simply the first \( n_1 \) integers:

\[
R_1^{\text{min}} = 1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + n_1
\]

This is the **sum of the first \( n_1 \) natural numbers**, which has a well-known formula:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n_1} k = \frac{n_1(n_1 + 1)}{2}
\]

**Example**:
- If \( n_1 = 3 \) (3 positives), the smallest possible ranks are **1, 2, 3**.
- The sum is \( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \).
- Using the formula: \( \frac{3 \times 4}{2} = 6 \) ‚úì

---

## **3. Why Subtract Min(R‚ÇÅ) in AUC Calculation?**
The Mann-Whitney **U statistic** is defined as:

\[
U_1 = R_1 - \frac{n_1(n_1 + 1)}{2}
\]

### **Interpretation**:
- \( R_1 \) = **Actual sum of ranks** for positives.
- \( \frac{n_1(n_1 + 1)}{2} \) = **Minimum possible sum** if all positives were ranked lowest.
- \( U_1 \) = **Excess ranking** beyond the worst-case scenario.

### **Connection to AUC**:
- If positives are **perfectly ranked higher** than negatives, \( R_1 \) will be large, and \( U_1 \approx n_1 n_2 \).
- If positives are **randomly mixed** with negatives, \( U_1 \approx \frac{n_1 n_2}{2} \).
- If positives are **all ranked below negatives**, \( U_1 \approx 0 \).

Thus, AUC normalizes \( U_1 \) by dividing by \( n_1 n_2 \):

\[
\text{AUC} = \frac{U_1}{n_1 n_2} = \frac{R_1 - \frac{n_1(n_1 + 1)}{2}}{n_1 n_2}
\]

---

## **4. Intuition Behind the Formula**
- The term \( \frac{n_1(n_1 + 1)}{2} \) **adjusts for the baseline** ranking that would occur if positives were indistinguishable from negatives (i.e., all ranked at the bottom).
- The difference \( (R_1 - \text{Min}(R_1)) \) measures **how much better** the positives rank compared to the worst case.

## **5. Example Walkthrough**
### **Given Data**
| Sample | Label (y) | Score | Rank (if sorted by score) |
|--------|----------|-------|---------------------------|
| A      | 0        | 0.1   | 1                         |
| B      | 0        | 0.3   | 2                         |
| C      | 1        | 0.4   | 3                         |
| D      | 1        | 0.5   | 4                         |
| E      | 1        | 0.8   | 5                         |

- \( n_1 = 3 \) (positives: C, D, E)
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (negatives: A, B)

### **Compute Min(R‚ÇÅ)**
The smallest possible sum of ranks for positives occurs if they are the **lowest-ranked**:
- Assign ranks **1, 2, 3** to positives (but in reality, negatives occupy these ranks).
- Thus, the **minimum possible sum** for positives is:
  \[
  \text{Min}(R_1) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 = \frac{3 \times 4}{2}
  \]

### **Compute Actual R‚ÇÅ**
In reality, positives have ranks **3, 4, 5**:
\[
R_1 = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12
\]

### **Compute U‚ÇÅ**
\[
U_1 = R_1 - \text{Min}(R_1) = 12 - 6 = 6
\]

### **Compute AUC**
\[
\text{AUC} = \frac{U_1}{n_1 n_2} = \frac{6}{3 \times 2} = 1.0
\]

This makes sense because **all positives (0.4, 0.5, 0.8) rank higher than all negatives (0.1, 0.3)**.

## **6. Key Takeaways**
1. **Min(R‚ÇÅ)** is the sum of ranks if all positives were **ranked at the bottom** (worst-case scenario).
2. **Subtracting Min(R‚ÇÅ)** from the actual rank sum \( R_1 \) measures **how much better** the model ranks positives than random.
3. **AUC** normalizes this difference to a probability between 0.5 (random) and 1.0 (perfect).

This derivation ensures that AUC correctly accounts for **tied rankings** and **baseline expectations**, matching statistical theory. üöÄ
