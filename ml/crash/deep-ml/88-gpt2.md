# GPT-2 Text Generation

### Implement a Simplified GPT-2-like Text Generation Function

You are tasked with implementing a simplified GPT-2-like text generation function in Python. This function will incorporate the following components of a minimal GPT-2 architecture:

-   **Token Embeddings**: Map input tokens to dense vector representations.
-   **Positional Embeddings**: Add positional information to token embeddings.
-   **Multi-head Attention**: Attend to various parts of the sequence.
-   **Feed-Forward Network**: Process attention outputs through a dense layer.
-   **Layer Normalization**: Stabilize the training process.

The function must take in the following parameters:

1.  **Prompt**: The initial text to guide the generation process.
2.  **Number of Tokens to Generate**: Specify how many tokens to output.

Your function should output the generated text.

Additionally, utilize the helper function `load_encoder_hparams_and_params` to retrieve:

-   A dummy encoder.
-   Model hyperparameters.
-   Model parameters.

Build your text generation logic around these components. This exercise is designed to help you understand the core concepts behind GPT-2's autoregressive text generation.

## Example:

### Input:

prompt="hello", n\_tokens\_to\_generate=5

### Output:

world <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>

### Reasoning:

The function encodes the input "hello" into tokens using the dummy encoder, then runs a simplified GPT-2 forward pass to generate 5 tokens. Finally, it decodes the generated tokens back into text.

# Understanding Transformer Architecture and Text Generation

Transformers have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) with their efficient and scalable architecture. This guide provides an in-depth look into the core components of transformers and how they facilitate advanced text generation.

## 1\. Introduction to Transformers

Transformers are a groundbreaking neural network architecture that has significantly advanced NLP. Introduced in the seminal paper _"Attention is All You Need"_ by Vaswani et al. (2017), transformers have outperformed traditional models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) in various NLP tasks.

### Key Advantages of Transformers

-   **Parallel Processing**:  
    Unlike RNNs, which process input sequences sequentially, transformers handle entire sequences simultaneously. This parallelism leads to substantial improvements in training speed and efficiency.
    
-   **Scalability**:  
    Transformers can effectively scale to handle large datasets and complex tasks, making them ideal for applications like language translation, text generation, and summarization.
    
-   **Self-Attention Mechanism**:  
    The core innovation of transformers is the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in a sequence relative to each other. This capability enables the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships within the text.
    

### Applications of Transformers

-   **Text Generation**: Creating coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt.
-   **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another with high accuracy.
-   **Text Summarization**: Condensing long documents into concise summaries while retaining key information.
-   **Question Answering**: Providing accurate answers to user queries based on contextual understanding.

## 2\. Core Concepts

To fully grasp the transformer architecture, it's essential to understand its foundational components. Below are the core concepts that constitute the building blocks of transformers:

### 2.1 GELU Activation Function

The Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU) is an advanced activation function that enhances the performance of deep neural networks.

**Mathematical Expression**:

GELU(x)\=0.5⋅x⋅(1+tanh⁡(2π⋅(x+0.044715⋅x3)))\\text{GELU}(x) = 0.5 \\cdot x \\cdot (1 + \\tanh(\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\cdot (x + 0.044715 \\cdot x^3)))GELU(x)\=0.5⋅x⋅(1+tanh(π2​​⋅(x+0.044715⋅x3)))

**Purpose**:  
GELU introduces non-linearity in the network while maintaining smooth gradient flow. Unlike the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) or Sigmoid functions, GELU provides a probabilistic approach to activation, allowing for better handling of uncertainty and improving model performance in deep architectures.

**Benefits**:

-   **Smooth Activation**: Reduces the likelihood of "dead neurons" that can occur with ReLU.
-   **Improved Gradient Flow**: Facilitates more stable and efficient training by preventing gradient vanishing or exploding.

### 2.2 Softmax for Attention

Softmax is a fundamental function used to convert raw attention scores into a probability distribution, ensuring that the weights sum to one.

**Mathematical Expression**:

Softmax(xi)\=exp⁡(xi)∑j\=1nexp⁡(xj)\\text{Softmax}(x\_i) = \\frac{\\exp(x\_i)}{\\sum\_{j=1}^n \\exp(x\_j)}Softmax(xi​)\=∑j\=1n​exp(xj​)exp(xi​)​

**Purpose**:  
In the context of attention mechanisms, Softmax normalizes the attention scores, enabling the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence by assigning higher weights to more important tokens.

**Example**:  
If the attention scores for a sentence are `[2, 1, 0.1]`, applying Softmax will convert these to probabilities like `[0.659, 0.242, 0.099]`, indicating the relative importance of each token.

### 2.3 Layer Normalization

Layer normalization stabilizes and accelerates the training process by standardizing the inputs across the features.

**Mathematical Expression**:

LayerNorm(x)\=g⋅x−μσ2+ϵ+b\\text{LayerNorm}(x) = g \\cdot \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 + \\epsilon}} + bLayerNorm(x)\=g⋅σ2+ϵ​x−μ​+b

Where:

-   ( \\mu ): Mean of input ( x ) along the last axis.
-   ( \\sigma^2 ): Variance of ( x ).
-   ( g, b ): Learnable scaling and bias parameters.
-   ( \\epsilon ): A small constant to prevent division by zero.

**Purpose**:  
By normalizing the inputs, layer normalization ensures that each layer receives inputs with a consistent distribution, which enhances training stability and convergence speed.

* * *

### 2.4 Multi-Head Attention

Multi-head attention is an extension of the attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on different representation subspaces simultaneously.

**Components**:

-   **Query (Q), Key (K), Value (V) Matrices**: Each attention head computes its own set of Q, K, and V matrices by projecting the input embeddings into different subspaces.
-   **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: Attention(Q,K,V)\=Softmax(QK⊤dk)V\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{Softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d\_k}}\\right)VAttention(Q,K,V)\=Softmax(dk​​QK⊤​)V

**Benefits**:

-   **Diversity of Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously.
-   **Enhanced Representation**: Captures richer features by aggregating multiple attention heads.

### 2.5 Feedforward Network (FFN)

The Feedforward Network is a simple yet powerful component applied to each position independently within the transformer.

**Mathematical Expression**:

FFN(x)\=Linear2(GELU(Linear1(x)))\\text{FFN}(x) = \\text{Linear}\_2(\\text{GELU}(\\text{Linear}\_1(x)))FFN(x)\=Linear2​(GELU(Linear1​(x)))

**Structure**:

1.  First Linear Layer: Projects the input to a higher-dimensional space.
2.  GELU Activation: Introduces non-linearity to the model.
3.  Second Linear Layer: Projects the data back to the original dimensionality.

**Purpose**:  
The FFN enhances the model's capacity to learn intricate patterns.

* * *

### 2.6 Transformer Block

A transformer block is the fundamental building unit of the transformer architecture, combining multi-head attention and the feedforward network with residual connections and layer normalization.

**Structure**:

-   **Multi-Head Attention Layer**:  
    x1\=LayerNorm(x+MHA(x))x\_1 = \\text{LayerNorm}(x + \\text{MHA}(x))x1​\=LayerNorm(x+MHA(x))
-   **Feedforward Network**:  
    x2\=LayerNorm(x1+FFN(x1))x\_2 = \\text{LayerNorm}(x\_1 + \\text{FFN}(x\_1))x2​\=LayerNorm(x1​+FFN(x1​))

**Advantages**:

-   **Deep Architecture Support**: Facilitates the construction of deep networks without significant performance degradation.
-   **Modularity**: Each transformer block can be stacked multiple times, allowing for scalable model depth.

* * *

### 2.7 GPT-2 Text Generation

GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) leverages the transformer architecture for generating human-like text. Developed by OpenAI, GPT-2 has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various NLP tasks.

**Key Components**:

-   **Word and Positional Embeddings**: Captures semantic meaning and token position in a sequence.
-   **Causal Attention**: Ensures left-to-right text generation by masking future tokens.
-   **Stacked Transformer Blocks**: Refines input representations iteratively.

**Text Generation Process**:

1.  Provide a prompt to initiate the process.
2.  Tokenize the input into embeddings.
3.  Process embeddings through transformer blocks.
4.  Generate the next token based on probabilities.
5.  Repeat steps 3-4 to produce coherent text.
