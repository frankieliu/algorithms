can you write pseudo code implementation of a gradient boosted tree
</frankie>

---
Certainly! Below is a **pseudo-code implementation** of a **Gradient Boosted Tree (GBT)** algorithm, specifically using **Gradient Boosting with Decision Trees** (often referred to as GBDT - Gradient Boosted Decision Trees).  

This implementation follows the standard approach of training an ensemble of weak learners (decision trees) sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous one using gradient descent optimization.

### **Pseudo-code for Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT/GBDT)**

```python
def gradient_boosted_trees(X, y, num_trees, learning_rate, max_depth):
    """
    X: Input features (n_samples, n_features)
    y: Target values (n_samples,)
    num_trees: Number of boosting iterations (trees)
    learning_rate: Shrinkage factor for tree contributions
    max_depth: Maximum depth of each decision tree
    """
    
    # Initialize model with a constant value (mean of target)
    initial_prediction = mean(y)
    predictions = [initial_prediction] * len(y)  # Initial predictions
    
    trees = []  # To store the weak learners (trees)
    
    for t in range(num_trees):
        # Compute pseudo-residuals (negative gradient of loss function)
        residuals = y - predictions  # For MSE loss, residual = (y - prediction)
        
        # Fit a decision tree to the residuals (approximate the negative gradient)
        tree = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=max_depth)
        tree.fit(X, residuals)
        
        # Update predictions by adding the tree's prediction (scaled by learning rate)
        tree_prediction = tree.predict(X)
        predictions += learning_rate * tree_prediction
        
        # Save the tree
        trees.append(tree)
    
    return trees, initial_prediction

def predict(X, trees, initial_prediction, learning_rate):
    """
    X: Input features to predict
    trees: List of trained decision trees
    initial_prediction: Starting prediction (mean(y))
    learning_rate: Same as in training
    """
    prediction = initial_prediction
    for tree in trees:
        prediction += learning_rate * tree.predict(X)
    return prediction
```

### **Key Components Explained**:
1. **Initialization**:  
   - Start with an initial prediction (e.g., the mean of the target `y` for regression).  

2. **Boosting Loop**:  
   - For each iteration `t`:  
     - Compute the **residuals** (negative gradient of the loss function).  
       - For **MSE loss**, residual = `y - prediction`.  
     - Fit a **decision tree** to predict these residuals (approximates the gradient).  
     - Update the predictions by adding the tree's predictions (scaled by `learning_rate`).  

3. **Prediction**:  
   - The final prediction is the sum of the initial prediction and all scaled tree predictions.

### **Variations & Extensions**:
- **Different Loss Functions**:  
  - For **binary classification**, use log loss (cross-entropy) and apply sigmoid to predictions.  
  - For **other losses**, compute gradients accordingly (e.g., Huber loss for robust regression).  

- **Regularization**:  
  - Add **subsampling** (stochastic gradient boosting) by training each tree on a random subset of data.  
  - Use **tree constraints** (e.g., `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`) to prevent overfitting.  

- **Learning Rate (Shrinkage)**:  
  - A smaller `learning_rate` (e.g., 0.1) requires more trees but often generalizes better.  

This pseudo-code captures the essence of **gradient boosting** (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost use optimized versions of this approach). Would you like an extended version with specific loss functions or more detailed regularization?
