Absolutely. Let's go over the **basics of diffusion models**, starting from first principles. This will give you a solid foundation for understanding both **image** and **video** diffusion.

## üßä What Is a Diffusion Model?

A **diffusion model** is a type of generative model that **learns to create data** (like images, audio, or video) by learning how to **reverse a noising process**.

### üîÑ Core Idea:

1. **Forward process** (corrupt data):

   * Gradually add Gaussian noise to an image over many steps until it turns into pure noise.
2. **Reverse process** (denoise):

   * Train a neural network to **undo** the noise step-by-step and recover the original image from random noise.

## üìâ 1. Forward Process: Adding Noise

Given a data sample $x_0$ (like a clean image), we define a series of increasingly noisy versions:

$$
x_0 \rightarrow x_1 \rightarrow x_2 \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow x_T
$$

Each $x_t$ is produced by adding a small amount of Gaussian noise:

$$
x_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \epsilon,\quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

Where:

* $\alpha_t$ is a noise schedule (typically decreasing).
* $T$ is the total number of steps (e.g., 1000).
* After enough steps, $x_T \approx \mathcal{N}(0, I)$, i.e., pure noise.

## üßº 2. Reverse Process: Denoising

The goal is to learn a **model $\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)$** that predicts the original noise $\epsilon$ added at each step.

Using this, we can recover less noisy versions by reversing the process:

$$
x_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \left( x_t - \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \cdot \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \right) + \text{noise}
$$

This allows us to go from **noise ‚Üí data**, step-by-step.

## üéØ 3. Objective Function

During training, the model is optimized using a simple **mean squared error loss**:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_{x_0, \epsilon, t} \left[ \left\| \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t) \right\|^2 \right]
$$

This means we:

* Pick a random time step $t$
* Add noise to $x_0$ to get $x_t$
* Train the model to predict the **exact noise** that was added

## üõ†Ô∏è 4. Model Architecture

Most diffusion models use a **U-Net** architecture:

* Downsampling path (encoder): captures global context
* Bottleneck: temporal or conditional info (e.g., time step $t$, text embedding)
* Upsampling path (decoder): restores resolution and detail

### Enhancements:

* **Time embeddings**: to condition on diffusion step $t$
* **Text/image guidance**: via CLIP, T5, or other encoders (used in models like Stable Diffusion)

## ‚ú® 5. Sampling

After training, we can generate a new sample:

1. Start with pure noise $x_T \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$
2. Iteratively denoise using the trained model:

   $$
   x_{T} \rightarrow x_{T-1} \rightarrow \dots \rightarrow x_0
   $$
3. The final $x_0$ is your generated image, audio, or video.

Faster samplers (e.g. DDIM, DPM++) use fewer steps (10‚Äì50 instead of 1000) and still get great results.
