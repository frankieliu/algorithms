Yes, **prompt engineering *can* be performed by an LLM**—in fact, it's a growing area often called **automated prompt optimization**, **self-prompting**, or **prompt generation**.

---

## 🧠 What does this mean?

LLMs can be used to:

1. **Generate prompts** that elicit better answers from themselves or other models.
2. **Rewrite, optimize, or compress prompts** to improve accuracy, coherence, or efficiency.
3. **Evaluate and iterate on prompts** via self-reflection or reward-based mechanisms.

## ✅ Examples of LLMs Performing Prompt Engineering

### 1. **Self-Prompting (Reflexion / Chain-of-Thought)**

* An LLM generates a reasoning chain that **improves its own performance**.
* Example:

  * First prompt: “How do I fix this code?”
  * LLM responds.
  * Then you prompt: “Reflect on your previous answer. Was it correct?”
  * LLM revises the answer based on self-critique.

### 2. **AutoPrompt (NeurIPS 2020)**

* LLMs are guided (even with gradient-based search) to find **trigger words** that best activate correct behavior.
* This was done even without labeled data, optimizing token-level prompts.

### 3. **Prompt Optimization via LLMs**

* Give an LLM examples of a task (e.g., summarizing text) and ask it to generate **better prompts** for the same goal.
* You can score candidate prompts (via reward models or accuracy) and use the best one.
* Meta-prompt: "Generate a prompt that would make another model give a concise summary of this article."

### 4. **LMQL / DSPy / Guidance**

* Frameworks where LLMs can generate or refine their own **subprompts** to achieve modular goals.
* For example: "If the first answer is too long, revise the prompt to reduce verbosity."

## 🧩 Techniques That Use This Idea

| Method              | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Reflexion**       | Model critiques and improves its own outputs           |
| **Self-Tuning**     | LLM iteratively adjusts prompts to improve performance |
| **AutoPrompt**      | Optimizes discrete prompts via search                  |
| **RLPrompt**        | Uses reinforcement learning to discover better prompts |
| **DSPy (Stanford)** | Modular, composable prompting with self-optimization   |

## ⚠️ Limitations

* LLMs may generate prompts that sound good but **don’t actually improve performance** unless evaluated properly.
* Needs an **objective function**: e.g., accuracy, BLEU score, human rating, etc.
* May require **multiple generations and evaluations**, which can be compute-expensive.

## ✅ Final Answer

> **Yes, LLMs can perform prompt engineering**, including generating, refining, and evaluating prompts — either manually (via chain-of-thought) or automatically (via optimization techniques). This is a key capability in building autonomous or self-improving AI systems.

Let me know if you want a concrete example or code that shows how to use an LLM to rewrite or optimize a prompt!
