pip install flask[async]

# Example

```python
    from flask import Flask, jsonify
    import asyncio

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/async_data")
    async def get_async_data():
        # Simulate an asynchronous I/O operation
        await asyncio.sleep(2)
        return jsonify({"message": "Data fetched asynchronously!"})

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run(debug=True)
```

# Handle asynchronous operations. 

Within your `async def` routes, you can `await` on coroutines for tasks like: 

- Making asynchronous HTTP requests (e.g., using `httpx`).
- Interacting with asynchronous databases.
- Performing other I/O-bound operations that benefit from non-blocking execution.

# Considerations for Synchronization: 

- **Blocking operations:**
    
    While `async/await` allows for non-blocking I/O, ensure that any CPU-bound
or blocking operations are moved to separate threads or processes (e.g., using
`asyncio.to_thread` or a task queue like Celery) to prevent blocking the event
loop. 
    
- **Context management:**
    
    When interacting with synchronous libraries or resources from an
asynchronous context, carefully manage the context to avoid issues like
`RuntimeError: You cannot use AsyncToSync in the same thread as an async event
loop` by ensuring operations are appropriately run in a separate thread if
necessary. 
    
- **Deployment:**
    
    When deploying, use a WSGI server that supports asynchronous workers (e.g.,
Gunicorn with `gevent` or `eventlet` workers, or uWSGI with `asyncio` support)
to fully leverage the asynchronous capabilities.
