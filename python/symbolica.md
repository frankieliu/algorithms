Don't necessarily touch
Mindset internally

startup - so many things to touch upon

where we see need for optimization

mattia - package things very quickly
good design 

generic set of tools consumable

iteration between model

motivation for doing this kind of work

configuration
- boring 
- having design applications that 
  are easily 
- help with security
- kubectl
- complements how to plug things together

Most approaches
category theory
Come accross differences in the past
applied category theory applied to ai
some idea of how reasoning work
application to reasoning to neural science
thinking in the reasoning process in the brain
take some of the concepts and approaches
ai steering and control space
leverage
formally constructing 
CPU does better than GPU
very interesting thinking multiple
agents interacting together
connect inputs and outputs
control and orchestration
different parts of the infrastructure at scale
GPU/networking
extract pass them efficiently to each other
applying stewartship
cybernetic control
formal verification
low latency inference requests
metrics to scale to scale inference end points
gateways - inferenec optimization
constraint generation
product specific these days
overlap with different teams
product / research
overlapping knowledge
infrastructure influence in how those things are being built
intersection of two things is valuable
challenging
paxos - lambert lamport
jane hillstone
process algebra
communicating seqential process
exponential distribution
complex markov trains
stochastic algebra
collective adaptive resource sharing
consensus protocol
performance protocols
orchestrating multi-agent systems
security perpective
internally 
data is less sensitive
artifact
training model weights
executing generating code to make it secure...

protein
user of ai techonology
explicit rules that need to follow
cannto legally
cannot place stock legally
put ai on rails
llms
ai models
can do this for any modles
smaller moe specific tasks
change how sample for llms
category theory of structure and resaoning
make sure that llms can make logacal errors
formal logic
