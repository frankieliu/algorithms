How do you lead without formal authority?
1. build trust and relationships
   - get to know people
   - be a good collaborator
   - listen actively
   - be a team player
2. demonstrate expertise and credibility
   - expert
   - share knowledge
3. end user
   - people need to run a lot of jobs
   - lot of them require GPUs and Apple Silicon
   - distributed computing problem
   - creating models and running inferences
   - job queue / db / quota management
   - creating the framework and runtime
   - support open source framework
   - allow them to make customization
   - primitives from li's team for orchestration
   - distribution training job
     - each node is progressing
     - if one of them failing
     - checkpoint
   - framework part
   - ray
   - spark distributed job
   - write a job on laptop
     - run on 1000 CPU machine
     - download command line tool
     - bow submit the job
       - doc image local file
       - command line to package it up
     - ray head / worker / define the yaml config
       - web page is running
       - how much
     - customization
     - service side, kubernetes side
       - right capacity and usage
       - scheduling
     - docker image
       - cuda version / docker image stuff
       - ray worker tell broadcast capture those things
       - thousand of different
     - pytorch for distributed training
       - checkpoint
       - matrix are put into
     - customization for each of these workload
     - standard way of doing things

- specific component

  - apple's engineers 2x-5x more scopre
  - most of the time
  - this team does blah
  - how to make it happen
  - own area is doing well
  - ad hoc
  - ownership

- what are the venues

  - documentation company
  - trust writing code
  - don't need a week
  - PR to improve
  - gain the trust
  - pretty strong of meeting people
  - seattle and silicon valley fly up and down

- three days a week policy

  - MP5
  - rely on the manager to build network

  - so many people build a lot of things from scratch
  - write good code
  - announcements
    - slack
    - product person
    - write good announcement
    - customer channel of 5k people
    - job will go 2% faster
    - impact

- venues

  - Friday tech talk
  - 100 people talk
  - weekly deep dive
  - talk with SVP

- iteration / acceleration

  - current 
  - production / management
  - somewhat similar / completely internal
  - treating production
  - career fast pace that we will find
  - internal infrastructure
  - test everything

- integration testing

- important qualities

  - 1. good engineer - good engineer, write good code

  - 2. there are no other - you should know what people need
       have a sense of what needs to be done
       sense of taste
       one month should be enough
