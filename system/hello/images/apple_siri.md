LLM focused
-----------

fine tuned adapters
very close to foundation models
approaches 
develop the right 
hong - responsible high dialogue response
experiences that are built
dialogue generated by the model
pre-training
prompt engineering

RAG based
---------
look up the relevant instruction
in the making

Host of different technologies

Anticipate future needs
- RAG
- extensions multimodal
- graph nn

Cross-eco system
- event monitoring

Competitive gap
- strategy advocate for a small iterative feature

Resource optimization
- ambitious goals
- low-effort initiative

Driving innovation

Cross-Functional
Enginering / design / business

Mentorship & elevating others
- 

Ownership
- full ownership
- heavy time

Adaptability
- had to pivot
- rapidly changing
- cannot get this measurement done

Senior 

Response relation modeling
Closely with design
Directly related - apple's design intent

- quality we have a lot of smarter people in the team
  speed efficiency 
  thinking out of the box
  delivery

- not easy
  plow through that bring lot of energy

- apple 
  - high priority it is that important
  - if something is important 
  - v1 and v2
