###### Design a Book Seller Platform

System Design

Senior-Staff, Manager-Senior Manager

Design a service where customers can submit book purchase requests with details such as customer information, book info, maximum price willing to pay, and payment information. The service should check with registered book sellers to find books priced at or below the maximum price. It should place a buy request with the seller offering the minimum price within the customer's limit. The design should include APIs for book seller registration and adapt to various seller APIs, supporting up to 10,000 queries per second.

###### Design a Distributed File System

System Design

Senior-Staff, Manager-Senior Manager

Design a hierarchical distributed file system where customers can store an arbitrary number of files and directories, nested recursively. Files should be immutable once created, while directories must be mutable to allow creating and deleting files and subdirectories. Implement APIs for file retrieval, storage, directory creation, listing, and deletion. The system should support hundreds of petabytes of storage for thousands of Databricks customers, operating within a single region and data center. Existing distributed storage systems cannot be reused, but single machine filesystems, databases, and KV stores can be utilized.
