###### What surprised you?

In your system design interview, plan on taking an example and going through your entire design. The coding problem question was rather long, use the interviewer to focus on important parts.

###### How did you prepare?

Learning to drive system design interviews and mocks.

###### What surprised you?

Time flies very fast during interviews. So practicing well is very important. Each type of round requires a special type of skillset. Also, it depends on the interviewee but interviews should be split between multiple days with not more than 2 rounds on the same day. Additionally, it is better to club one coding round with one design or behavioral because design or behavioral round sucks a lot of your vocal energy. I gave 1 design and 1 behavioral on the same day and my throat was dead after that.

###### How did you prepare?

I think there are a lot of materials on the internet for coding rounds but very few on preparing for system design specially for Meta/Google etc which has a special requirement of completing everything under 40 mins. Even though I had the knowledge for various system design concepts, I was lacking the structure, the flow and time optimisation which hello interview taught me efficiently. I realised this when my friends conducted mocks and I performed poorly. I believe hello interview was a great platform for quickly getting me ready for the interviews and even clearing it.

###### Top tip for others?

Coding: It doesn't matter if you know all the DS and Algo, but it requires good practice of actually solving the questions within time limit (15-17 mins) with proper communication to clear this round. Design: There are no shortcuts to this round, get as much knowledge about the core concepts as possible, and practice the approach mentioned by Hello Interview (FR, NFR, Core Entities, APIs....) to excel it. The best advice I got for this round from Hello Interview is to not write the requirement only for the sake of writing, but cover them one by one, and that too starting with covering FR completely and then NFR.

###### Additional notes

Meta interviews are tough in general, and can be challenging to prepare for coding, design and behavioral rounds all in one go, but I think the way to succeed in this is to consistently practice them, get mocks and read previous interview experiences.

###### What surprised you?

I was prepared well for phone screen(at least that's what i thought) and my recruiter and many other lc discuss posts said that in the phone screen, they don't generally ask hards, and this was the only hard (making a large island) that i was going to study at the last moment before the interview but just didn't. These questions are very much such that if you know you know, else you cannot figure them out on the spot, esp with 15 mins limit.

In the feedback call with HR I was told that I was given weak hire in one of the DSA rounds because in the recursive function I did not pass the variable by reference. This was a shock as I had solved the problem correctly only because of this tiny detail I was given a weak hire.

###### Top tip for others?

Please explain the approach of the solution in detail in the DSA rounds, I had solved the questions correctly in the DSA round but was rejected because I did not express my thoughts while coding out loud

###### What surprised you?

I did not have any prior experience with system programming type interviews, was pretty surprised by the question going into that round

###### How did you prepare?

Practicing & reviewing common system design questions from hello interview (as well as a few different ones from the interview experiences section).

###### Top tip for others?

Don't just look at the most optimal solution but understand why it's better than the alternatives, so you can justify your design to the interviewer

###### Additional notes

The content on hello interview was super useful. I think its guided practice tool is way easier than the actual interview though (where you have to figure out the requirements and deep dive topics yourself), so make sure to also practice system design questions with no/limited guidance.

###### What surprised you?

The Interviewer was very reasonable, it was more like a technical discussion with a colleague.

###### How did you prepare?

The most valuable part of preparing with System Design using Hello Interview, was that I have a good overall understanding of System Design for different types of applications and can use that knowledge for any system design and even at work. I knew many of the concepts discussed at Hello Interview, I learned a lot of new concepts. Most importantly, it has given me the confidence to tackle different types of problems with this knowledge.

###### Top tip for others?

Going through the System designs on Hello Interview relevant to your domain will certainly help with your interview. Going through Mock interviews will help give you the feel for an interview setting if you have just started interviewing and will certainly boost your confidence.

###### What surprised you?

40 minutes for System Design is tight on time. There is not a lot of room for meandering/thinking through the problem. Even if the problem is not in your domain. I spent 10-12 minutes on pinning down Functional and Non-functional requirements, making sure my basis was covered. I likely spent too much time here. I spent 30 minutes on design, focusing a lot on Data modeling, hot partitioning, etc since my domain is in data. However, I likely got dinged on depth. I did not have sufficient time to go over failure modes, etc. I suspect this led to my down level.

###### How did you prepare?

Don't neglect leetcode, even if it's not for leveling. It's your admission ticket. Lock that down.

###### Top tip for others?

\- You need to showcase depth in System Design even if the problem is outside of your domain. - My lesson learned is to be quicker on "high level design" even if it is insufficient/not interesting. You want to leave room for deliberate discussion on tradeoffs, bottlenecks, and failure modes. Avoid jumping straight to detailed design. It may work against you in "lack of depth" since you cover less ground, and less interactive discussion with your interviewer.

###### What surprised you?

The System Design round was much more infrastructure-focused than typical product system designs. It leaned heavily on backend fundamentals, which I didn’t expect going in. The "Hello Interview" platform is primarily product-focused, but practicing those helped me quite a lot.

###### How did you prepare?

Coding: Solving every Snowflake-tagged LeetCode problem was the best decision I made. System Design: I highly recommend reviewing the “Key Technologies” section in the Hello Interview guide and ensuring your basics are clear.

###### Top tip for others?

Do not skip the Snowflake-tagged problems on LeetCode. They’re extremely representative of the actual interviews. Don’t worry about finishing your entire System Design. I only completed about 75% of mine, but was able to answer follow-up questions confidently, and that mattered more.

###### Additional notes

All three Coding rounds were fair and smooth. The Behavioral round was more like a deep dive into my past work than a formal Q&A. Even though I didn’t finish the full System Design, being calm, clear, and solid on the basics helped me get through.

Interviewed in June 2025

###### What surprised you?

The question itself. There are so many options for companies/interviewers to choose from that I was initially taken aback and a bit bummed I hadn't been asked one of the problems outlined on HI. Even more of a bummer, I'd seen the question on the Real Interview Questions page and hadn't made time to think through it!

###### How did you prepare?

Most valuable was working through the content under the Learn System Design section: In a Hurry, Core Concepts, sample Question Breakdowns, Key Technologies, and Patterns. All the Hello Interview content is really good. At the recommendation of a friend, I started watching HI system design walkthroughs on Youtube, so I wasn't initially aware of the HI offering. (There are HI links on the Youtube video pages, but I was more focused on the videos themselves.) Once I clicked through, I found more content, but it was some time before I realized I could create a free account. After that, I started to realize the volume of content available, but it still took a while for me to discover its depth. There's a lot of material in the In a Hurry and Core Concepts sections of Learn System Design in the left nav and by the time I discovered it, I was short on prep time.

###### Top tip for others?

Make the time to go through as much of the material as you can. Even if you've worked with the concepts before, it's helpful to refresh your memory and see how you might present it back in an interview setting.

###### Additional notes

Thanks, HI, for creating such a solid platform! I hope to see Learning Paths added soon!

Interviewed in June 2025

###### What surprised you?

Interviewers are welcoming, warm, and supportive. If you’re well-prepared, they’ll help you work through the problem. No one’s out to reject you or boost their own ego—everything is professional, and the goal is simply to see if you’re a good fit.

###### How did you prepare?

I practiced in a “real-world” setting— copy-pasting a task from leetcode into Google Docs, writing all my thoughts, then validating them with ChatGPT. This gave me confidence for coding interviews, as I knew what to expect and how to handle them. I also practiced system design on HelloInterview—it’s great and worth every penny.

###### Top tip for others?

Prepare thoroughly and focus on “real-world” practice—use HelloInterview for system design and Google Docs with LeetCode questions for coding. Studying endlessly (LeetCode, design articles) is only 20% of success; practice makes up the other 80%.

###### Additional notes

Don’t overthink—do plenty of “real-world” practice and focus on medium-level LeetCode problems. Expect ~2 problems in the interview (a main one plus a follow-up). No need to spend too much time on hard problems.

I expected to have like 2 or 3 code problems, but was only presented with 1 hard one. I also tried to check if my data structure decision was correct by checking with my interviewer, but they said my solution was good enough.

###### How did you prepare?

I honestly don't know, I just grinded LeetCode problems and summed up some clues and tips to know when a problem is shouting at me to use a data structure or pattern.

###### Top tip for others?

It's my first time passing a coding interview after many failures, so if I had to give one is: when you start, it feels like you aren't good enough, that you are not good at it. Just keep trying. At some point you will get decent at it. The rest is luck.

Interviewed in June 2025

###### What surprised you?

Really unique coding rounds. You can look this up, but Stripes interviews are incredibly practical. They interviews are also extremely challenging. For many of the rounds, you're not expected to even come close to completing all the parts.

###### How did you prepare?

It's help to know common HTTP-request-wrappers in your language of choice.

###### Additional notes

Work fast. Helps to be able to write well-structured code on the go. Many of the rounds test your ability to write re-usable/modular code.

Interviewed in June 2025

###### What surprised you?

I feel like giving a few mocks should have given me a good idea, I fumbled on basic questions. The top k question surprised me a little as I was quickly done with it and didnt have anything else to say, they wanted to add a widget on user page to show top 10 songs listened by users.

###### How did you prepare?

The format followed on HelloINterview is very good and that helps, for coding I followed a Coding with MinMer channel and only focused on their Meta playlists

###### Top tip for others?

For meta coding rounds follow the Coding with MinMer channel and practice the meta playlist, also prepare the meta LC questions. Do practice simple quesions as well, I kind of fumbled on a Linked List ques, which hurts the most. For system design, try to cover all the SD questions shared here on HelloInterview at least 2 weeks before your interview then practice couple of mocks.

###### Additional notes

Would also recommend a Behavioral mock

###### What surprised you?

For the "laptop interview" I got stuck on the stdin stdout portion. This interview is 90 mins, first 15 is spent going over your background with the interviewer, next 15 is spent going over the question and planning implementation with the interviewer. The next 60 is spent coding independently while the interview is muted and cam turned off. You are allowed to use google for help.

###### How did you prepare?

The system design and practice STAR questions using the hellointerview platform.

Interviewed in June 2025

###### What surprised you?

Honestly? Very little. Both the coding and system design questions can feature slight twists from their "generic" equivalents, but otherwise the content and recommendations available here are very accurate.

###### How did you prepare?

For self study, Hello Interview's system design interview framework and question breakdowns were invaluable. The top ~50 Meta-tagged questions on LeetCode will get you far with DSA. Mock interviews with Meta interviewers (booked here) were very useful for identifying weak spots and understanding how candidates are evaluated.

###### Top tip for others?

The technical questions are not necessarily very difficult—you're meant to be able to solve the coding ones in 20 minutes each—but you're being evaluated for so much more than just getting the "right" answer. Arriving at a working solution is required, but your communication, design, thought process, etc. are what will ultimately decide the outcome.

###### Additional notes

Hello Interview is a terrific resource; I wish they could tell me how to do the actual job as well.

Interviewed in June 2025

###### How did you prepare?

I prepared stories for behavioral and heavily prepared coding for the initial interview but before full loop stage I decided I needed only 3-4 days to go through patterns and some meta leetcode tasks and just think about solution - If I know the solution, I skip and read next one so I would say I was just un trained for coding during this design period preparation

###### Top tip for others?

still grind leetcod, design and nail stories - nothing to add here also funny one if you're not native you need to learn proper words for design because they can think you didn't go deeper if you do not say proper words that highlight strong side of the technology like intergrety (because if you use by mistake wrong terminology you fail immediately)

###### Additional notes

Meta coding is simple enough - they're mentioning hard but I bet they never give you a hard task - not possible to solve hard in 17min...

The problem need us to define "how to calculate top-K trendy song", so we need to consider timely factor in our top-K calculation, which is not included in current HelloInterview problem.

###### How did you prepare?

1\. Paid human mock interview worth the price 2. The hellointerview materials (posts, videos, and AI-mock interviews)

###### Top tip for others?

1\. Know the delivery framework and be fluent about it 2. Know the basics, and when/how to apply appropriate knowledge 3. Learn how to discuss tradeoff

###### Additional notes

1\. I think there are some bad materials for system deign interview on the internet. So be careful not learning interview from those materials. Bad materials includes off-topic deep dives, not complete delivery frameworks, etc. 2. To counter the first point, I suggest stick on HelloInterview and get the taste for what a good/bad system interview is, then go and see other materials.

Interviewed in May 2025

###### What surprised you?

It is the way the questions are framed. It might seem like a straight forward question, but there is always a catch.

###### How did you prepare?

Not just breadth but depth of concepts. I focused on understanding how everything worked, and it helped.

###### Top tip for others?

We all prepare and practice a list of questions. This list usually covers most architectural patterns. And during the interview, we try to put the question in one of the previously solved questions' category and try to build it from there. This works, but I'd suggest to take a minute or two before you put in a category. When asked the question seems like it belongs to a category but in reality it might belong to another. If you pick the wrong one and start build it, you'll end up in a wrong place.

###### Additional notes

Depth >> Breadth. I was asked to explain how some indexes work.

Mocks, of course. I did 2 with hellointerview.com, 3 with friends, and 1 was provided by Google for free.

###### Top tip for others?

Try to be versatile with your preparation - mix reading about system design fundamentals, watching YouTube interviews, doing mocks, and discussing learned concepts with AI - focus on what is your current largest knowlege/ability gap and how to fill it the fastest. Don't leave the mocks for the last week, start them early and do them at least every couple of days.

Interviewed in May 2025

###### What surprised you?

I had prepared to code in Python for the interviews, but all the interviewers seemed to expect me to use C++. This may have been due to the role I applied for or because my resume mentions C/C++ as my primary programming language. Although I eventually wrote the code in Python, I wonder—though it's probably unlikely—if that worked against me, especially if the teams that were interested in me were specifically looking for C++ expertise.

###### Top tip for others?

Practicing mock interviews is a must. Try as many mock interviews as possible with folks who can provide you an honest feedback and suggest corrections.

The web crawling was limited to the wikipedia domain only.

###### How did you prepare?

1/ I ran out of time to have a mock interview but it would be great to have one. 2/ There are several design patterns we can follow, well summarized by Stefan and Evan. I’ve found it useful to choose a pattern based on the requirements. If we pick the right one, we can’t go too far wrong.

###### Top tip for others?

Review as many system design examples as possible.

Interviewed in May 2025

###### What surprised you?

Research multiple ways to solve an answer. Upon reflection, one of the system design questions I was asked had been covered here on HI but the interviewer had changed the constraints to test my knowledge about other subsystems. I wasn't ready to consider the alternative during the interview

###### How did you prepare?

Going through as many practices as I could. By the end I felt comfortable explaining most design patterns and tradeoffs to interviewers - just wasn't practiced enough.

###### Top tip for others?

Find Mock Interviews. Time management is critical in these interviews and realizing when you've made a mistake is also essential. You can't build that muscle unless you've gone through enough interviews.

###### What surprised you?

Interviewer is willing to help you out so make sure you express yourself that you are stuck at the problem by saying I seem to be lost with facial expression.

###### How did you prepare?

At least 50+ Meta tagged leetcode questions from last 3 months by frequency, ideally up to 75-100

###### Top tip for others?

You only have around 35 minutes to solve 2 leetcode problems. That leaves you with 15-18 minutes per problem to perform clarification, proposing with suboptimal and optimal solutions, coding the solution, complexity analysis, and manual testing without compiler. Make sure know optimal and suboptimal solutions for each problem.

###### What surprised you?

System design was quite difficult imo. Question was news aggregator like google news which was essentially two questions - a web scraper + feed distribution system . For the web scraper they wanted to go into details on how you should determine what category a article should go into (answer was AI/LLM based), how to handle a changing number of news sources (started at 50k then expanded), how to determine number of publishers a given thread should be responsible for scraping. News feed part seemed similar to instagram or twitter, fan out pattern based on what categories the user was interested in.

###### How did you prepare?

System design, particularly instagram + web crawler.

###### Additional notes

They allow AI throughout the coding interview process if you want. You can opt to use AI or not at the beginning of the interview. There are separate questions for using AI vs not using AI. I choose not to use it.

Leetcode was surprisingly easy - questions were variations of the Leetcode Premium Meta tagged questions and were very doable if you know the basic Leetcode patterns. In System Design unfortunately I got a problem that had very little overlap with most problems in Hello Interview and the that likely may have cost me the job offer.

###### How did you prepare?

Just practicing Leetcode questions like doing top 150 2-3x. It was overkill based on the questions I ended up getting but wanted to be on the safe side in case a harder a question did get.

Hello interview. My work stack is a bit different than the system design questions, mine was more like 'job scheduler' only. If without hello interview, I might be still struggling at the books and random materials. Thanks Evan for your detailed videos, personally I feel video much easier than reading. Specially thanks for Stephen ping me weeks ago in email as 'what can I help', and thanks myself I asked him. I did not know the questions list here and he send me the link of the questions people posted here, espcially for system design. That's give me huge huge direction for preparation. That's why I am writing here, thanks a lot guys, to put up a list for system freq questions and thanks for the friends ever post the real question here. Highly appreciated!

I made the mistake of scaling out too early and added cache unnecessarily resulting in somewhat complex design. Start with low volume workflow that works and depending on the requirements, that may be sufficient. Do not add unnecessary complexity.

###### What surprised you?

The system design was not a typical "Design Youtube". Instead they asked to discuss a prior project and go in depth. This may change going forward as its a small company right now.

###### How did you prepare?

Understanding system design was still very helpful, to put my past projects in context and understand other technologies out there. Especially when discussing things we could have done differently.

###### Top tip for others?

The behavioral seemed very important. They didn't want someone who was just a tech wiz, but someone who could work in a start up and dynamic environment with complex teams.

###### Additional notes

I really liked how human everything felt. I didn't feel like I was put under the gun or judged. Just a conversation about your experience and opportunities to flex your knowledge. They asked follow ups to make sure you weren't just BS'ing and could go in depth.

Nothing unexpected. Coding round questions were slight variants of leetcode version, nothing too complicated.

###### How did you prepare?

Mock interviews helped a lot.

###### Top tip for others?

Do as many mock interviews as possible. They help you structure your thought process and build confidence, especially if your interview skills are a bit rusty. Interviewers are looking for signals. It’s your responsibility to provide as many positive signals as you can. Be intentional about this during your interviews—particularly in behavioral and system design rounds.

Nothing else.

During the system design round, i was particularly asked to jump into Non-Functional requirements, which made me fumble a bit due to non-existent High Level design, followed by a lot of questions in deep dive.

The interviewer was really keen for me to focus on writing as much SQL as possible. I know SQL 'when I use it', but most of my projects haven't needed it for a year, I was too rusty and messed up the syntax, despite trying to conceptually communicate my intentions and drive the interview in the direction of the framework.

I enjoyed the virtual practice sessions on Hello Interview, it was helpful but not a full replacement for Mock Interviews. Despite the cost, I think that would make huge difference.

###### Top tip for others?

At least for Meta, avoid the Product Arch interview. Its a gamble in terms of what you'll get, take the time to level up on system design, even if you're more UX focused engineer.

###### What surprised you?

I actually didn't get a standard "tell me about yourself" question in my behavioral interview. My interviewer went straight for focused questions. Because of this, I worried that I didn't talk enough about my current role, but it seems my interviewer got the signals he needed.

###### How did you prepare?

The system design videos and guided practices from Hello Interview were pure gold. In my previous job search I lost a couple of opportunities to failed system design rounds, and I didn't understand what I was doing wrong. The Hello Interview resources provided a structure to follow and helped me understand what to do and what not to do.

###### Top tip for others?

It's all about preparation, and we're fortunate to have excellent resources for this at our disposal. Grind LeetCode, do the system design guided practices, use the story builder, do as many mock interviews as you can.

###### Additional notes

I am not a LeetCode wizard, so my strategy going into the full loop was to really try to crush my prod arch and behavioral interviews to buy myself some cushion for any shortcomings in the coding rounds. I think this worked, because I botched a hard question in my first coding interview, but I was offered a follow-up coding interview which I passed.

The time was not enough at all for the system design it looked like. I tried to finish as much width of the design as possible but before I knew it I had not gotten to all non-functional requirements, not done back of the envelope calculation or even iterated over basic approaches.

###### What surprised you?

For one of my System Design interviews I was asked design Instagram and the interviewer asked me really detailed questions about how the API works, specifically the upload media part. This surprised me a bit because I hadn't dug super deep into that area and just thought I could say "client upload to S3 directly". For coding, there were some interviews where I didn't completely solve the 2nd question (there are 2 questions in each coding interview) and so I assumed I must've failed. However, I passed and so I think as long as you get 1 and are able to get most of the logic down for the 2nd one and are able to talk through your thought process, you might still have a chance!

###### How did you prepare?

Hello Interview! Read most of the articles and videos and tried to practice as many questions as I could. For anything you're not super clear on, dig deeper with ChatGPT. Also doing a mock interview! This was key to helping me realize my blind spots.

###### Top tip for others?

For System design, practice out loud! For me, just reading the answer keys helped, but wasn't quite enough. I would think that I understood everything but when it came to the actual interview, I would realize blind spots that I had where I couldn't justify my decisions as well while talking out loud. For coding, if you're targeting Meta, get Leetcode premium and filter questions based on company. Practice the most frequently asked questions as much as you can so it's almost muscle memory. There are other companies that still do these "leetcode"-style questions, but there are a lot of other companies that aren't as algorithmic heavy and are more "real-world", practical. So make you you get good at using hashmaps, iterating through lists, sorting, etc.

###### Additional notes

Stay positive! I've gotten a ton rejections through this experience and it can be super demoralizing at times. It is a super tough market right now. Just know that you are still getting better and keep your head up! If you notice you're running into a wall/getting stuck, try doing a mock interview! Getting feedback from Evan was one of the most valuable parts of this experience. He gave me constructive, actionable feedback that I was actually able to put into practice. Shout out to Evan!!!

###### What surprised you?

Behavioral interview. This is impossible to prepare in terms of answering most common questions. They didn't even ask "tell me about yourself" or "tell me about your favorite project" questions.

###### How did you prepare?

Being consistent, go more depth than breadth. 2 months of leetcode (since I never did it before), 1 month system design, starting from the very basics and 3-4 days for the behavioral preparation. I was doing this after work every day and during the weekends, leaving one day to rest. Moc interviews and guided practice are very helpful!

###### Top tip for others?

Stay consistent with coding. Even if easy questions taking you 40 minutes to solve at start - this is normal. I recommend don't spend more time to solve it yourself. Look at the solution, but truly understand it! There is plenty of content online and chatgpt is actually pretty great with explaining solutions. With system design start with basics and focus on a core parts of the system. While designing just think logically, like can this job be done asynchronously? If so, introduce some queue. What is some DB goes down? Replication. How user can access content quickly? Caching. etc. Behavioral is the hardest to prepare and I recommend don't even look at the most popular questions because you may never see them in interview. Focus on knowing yourself and your experience. List things you proud of or what just being cool and memorable. Think of challenges you had and list them as well. Then, reiterate on that list and think how it translates into impact for project/product/company. Or how it could be possibly translated ;) Just knowing yourself and being able to talk about your experience is enough.

###### Additional notes

Every little thing during the process matters. HR's is your friends and they can help you and even pull you out after rejection during the screening phase. This what happened with me. So be honest with them and just be yourself.

###### What surprised you?

Nothing, this was my second loop with Meta. I was just not prepared, for my first loop i prepped for months and I passed all my rounds except behavior, for this one I only prepped for a couple weeks.

###### How did you prepare?

For coding: Using Anki in combination with Leetcode for Meta sorted by frequency < 3 months. For Sys D: Hello World Sys D practice was very helpful.

###### Top tip for others?

Prep every day, even for 1 hour a day, because it's hard to review everything in 2-4 weeks.

###### What surprised you?

The lack of rigidity when coming up with the solution is a bit dazzling at the start but it is actually helpful. Contrary to what you do when doing Leetcode, you can just skim some very complex part to show it works before actually coding these parts.

###### How did you prepare?

Grind (unfortunately) leetcode problems. At least neetcode 150.

###### Top tip for others?

Study a lot more than you need and do mocks alone or guided.

The values question was exactly as advertised. Coding was easier than expected, but I needed to write out the testing scenario which meant I needed to write code to build a tree such that I could test my tree traversal algorithm.

Diving extremely deep on system design. It's probably the most valuable interview for leveling.

###### Top tip for others?

Write code quickly. Practice writing code in your own environment and write out test cases. Dive deep into system design as each topic (reddis, dynamo, ...) will help.

###### What surprised you?

How easy the leetcode problems were compared to what I prepped Also as a E4 I was expected to navigate the whole product design interview and interviewer didn't ask questions on deep dive.

###### How did you prepare?

DSA: Pattern matching leetcode problems, reviewing problems of yesterday, writing down how to solve a problem after solving one, learning all the different ways to solve a problem Design: Learning components first, then going through each of the design prompts, solving them in platform first, then watch video and practice alongside, then read the article because some times it has more info on some part, doing mocks and finding gaps and learning those gaps, reading deep technical sections only on parts that I wouldn't know about.

###### Top tip for others?

Everyone's journey is really different, someone do multiple interviews before the one they actually get, and some one like me prep only for one interview but go all in and thankfully get it. Even if life gets crazy hard, and even if crazy things happen along the way, remind yourself maybe I'm getting too close and universe want to make sure I'm actually ready.

###### How did you prepare?

The interview was made of 3 technical steps, an online assessment on Hackerrank, including an SQL query, an easy-medium coding challenge, an implementation in Java involving a REST API with pagination. Taking Hackerrank's certifications are a useful traning for this part. As for the code review, I prepared with Claude and generated pieces of code that needed adjustment, had bugs or vulnerabilities. There was also a system design part, which I mainly prepared using Hello Interview's resources. The company works in the fintech industry, so the actual design problem is not one that has been covered here (a Digital Wallet). Despite this, Evan and Stefan's videos and system design practice exercises on the platform have helped me build a framework that came in handy during the interview.

Do not neglet behavioural rounds. I prepared thoroughly this time and it paid off. Hello Interview's story builder was useful, although the generated stories do not feel natural to tell. I refined them separately with Claude. Try to establish a connection with your interviewer early on, the first 5 minutes serve to establish the tone for the rest of the interview. Look up your interviewers before the interview, try to understand what they may expect from you based on their past experiences.

###### What surprised you?

During my coding interview I was surprised at how reasonable my interviewer was... I didn't remember specific function names in some cases and he was not concerned about that. That was nice because in coderpad you don't have tab completion. In many ways I think luck matters a lot in these interviews, if you get someone who is not engaged you will struggle.

###### How did you prepare?

practicing system design on the excildraw board does help a lot.

###### Top tip for others?

If you have a strange experience with an interviewer , please inform your recruiter. They can be surprisingly helpful.

###### Additional notes

For managers the project retrospective and behavioral interviews seem to matter a lot. It is tempting to ignore them to focus on coding interviews but I feel that is a mistake. I think Meta has recently lowered the bar a bit on the coding interviews for managers and raised it on the other aspects.

I had two interviews, where I didn't have enough time to fully solve the question, but clearly, the interviewers felt like they saw enough signal

Every interviewer was very friendly and helpful on the interviews, if I got stuck they helped me with tips on how to think of an approach. Only one of them wasn't very helpful and wanted me to assume things when I wasn't very clear on the problem specifics. Overall the interviewers and googlers in general are very nice and want you to succeed

###### How did you prepare?

I started with the fundamentals of algorithms and data structures, leetcode 75 and 150 are very helpful once you are confident with the fundamentals.

###### Top tip for others?

Practice medium and hard problems, if you can't come up with how to solve a problem you can always check the solution to understand every corner of the solution. With practice you'll start to detect patterns on problems and solutions.

###### What surprised you?

I assumed that the data ingress was not part of the design but the interviewer said it is one of the important elements of the design. So I had to take care of that on the fly.

###### How did you prepare?

The framework laid out in this material was very helpful. The Ticketmaster design helped with answering the booking part very confidently.

###### Top tip for others?

Practice practice practice. It is one thing to go over the design in your head but when you say it out loud, it is easy to miss the details in that window of time. Another tip is that when the interviewer dives deep into certain aspects, it is easy to get lost in that weeds. It is important to be conscious to get back on track with completing the design on time.

###### Additional notes

This site is tremendously helpful. I love how you laid out the junior, midlevel and staff level would answer. It would be great to see more insights about engineering leadership roles and what are expected. It cant be the same as staff level although some companies expect to that level. I generally disagree with that view and think as an industry we should talk more about it.

Practice mock interviews. Even with significant knowledge it is hard to fit into time slot without practice. And practice to tell your behavioural stories to sound more confident

System Design: If you are new to System Design, consider broad approach where you spend your time on various of topics and recorded mocked interview, patterns and topics such as E-commerce, Uber, URL shortener,... This would get you broad knowledge on how to solve a problem. Then after that, make it deeper in terms of db selection, consistency, scalability...

Interviewed in April 2025

###### What surprised you?

\- Sometimes, the interviewers are very specific about the areas they want you to deep-dive in. I often would start to deep dive on the parts that I found interesting just to be stopped and asked to talk about something I found rather mundane. - The interviewer makes or breaks the interview. - Behavioral interview was nothing like what was documented. I did not have the opportunity to give my "Tell me about yourself" elevator pitch and the interviewer had a set of prepared questions and very obviously was stopping me mid speech, reading through his list, and choosing a new question to ask.

###### How did you prepare?

\- System design practice was really important for learning how to structure my ideas. - Break downs of various technologies like Redis were great refreshers after being laid off for so long.

###### Top tip for others?

\- In addition to doing the System Design exercises, practice actually writing the requirements yourself. My first system design was a wake-up call because the exercises write the requirements for you. - Stay up to date on this stuff even when you're not actively interviewing. Years of intellectual complacency made preparing much much harder. - Do not try to pretend to know anything and do not underestimate your interviewer. \* One interviewer and I had a miscommunication and he started to grill me. I can imagine, had I not known what I was talking about, that would have been horrifying. \* Another interviewer threw in a bonus requirement to a system design if we had time. We didn't have time, but he let me know that he was one of the original engineers in the field of that topic.

###### Additional notes

\- It pays to be kind and communicative.

###### What surprised you?

The depth in which the behavioral round went was too overwhelming. There were some super minute details which I was not aware of, the interviewer was highly experienced and touch those aspects. The initial expectation in LLD interview was quite scary for me, I was supposed to come up with a multi-threaded approach. But I built a normal scheduler first and tried to build up on top of it.

###### How did you prepare?

Since this was mid-senior role I mostly focused on getting the design interviews right. Got a lot of help after reading the HLD design questions from this platform. I got my basics right and after that its mostly about if you can adapt to whats presented to you.

###### Top tip for others?

Spend time with system design prep. I have seen reading through system design questions and solutions seems everything is super obvious, but its not, atleast for me :) Try to do a question on your own before reading on what can be done, because once you read it, it seems like yeah this was obv.

\- Meta has very clean and simple career portal. HRs and Recruiting coordinators were really good. - It was really hard to follow what the System Design interviewers were saying. One of the interviewer came 10 mins late and took 10 mins to explain question. Leaving me very little time to understand what she said and answer. Of the 10 mins that she spoke, i understood hardly a minute. I took keywords and answered.

###### How did you prepare?

Design rounds were not that clear and I am not sure what went wrong as all the rounds were great and I was able to provide the answers successfully for the coding round. I believe it is the design round which was not up to the mark

###### How did you prepare?

Learning the approach for design interview, listing function and non functional requirements along with core entities.

###### Top tip for others?

Coding rounds are fine and as two questions needs to be solved they are subset of a large problem or basic array based questions. I would recommend to spend more time on learning design concepts

The format and style of the interviews were just as I expected. However, they probed deeply into the behavioral questions.

###### How did you prepare?

Coding: Doing Leetcode and practice on low level design System design: Hello interview Behavioral: practice with friends and family member

###### Top tip for others?

Make sure your answer to the behavioral question includes the following four key elements — I can't emphasize this enough: 1. Proactive and Reactive 2. Data-Driven 3. Impact-Oriented (Include metrics, percentages, increases/decreases, or efficiency gains) 4. Influence (Demonstrates impact on your direct team or across the organization)

###### Additional notes

People tend to underestimate the importance of preparing for behavioral questions, but you need to have solid stories for all the Amazon Leadership Principles. Interviewers will probe deeply into each story you share.

Repetition was the key for me - I think I did good in the areas where I was able to revise multiple times.

###### Top tip for others?

Do tagged questions but also prepare all the important data structures. I did not have much time to prepare but I feel repetitive preparation and actual working knowledge of the technologies will really help for system design rounds. Do not just listen or read system design questions and solutions, parallel practice them as much as you can.

###### What surprised you?

Less emphasis on scale in the system design interview and more focus on API and database design.

###### How did you prepare?

System design mocks and guided practice/video helped a lot with the API design and database schema.

###### Top tip for others?

Make sure you are competent with API design, database schemas, OOP, and concurrency patterns (locks, async, ...)

###### Additional notes

Process is a computer science fundamentals interview (leetcode) followed by a virtual onsite consisting of 3 rounds - system design - programming language fluency - behavioral programming language fluency was OOP + some concurrency questions

Bar raiser was very challenging. I could feel the bar raiser was a different level.

###### How did you prepare?

Hello Interview is pure gold mine. I had exponential improvement after doing hello interview for 15 days continuously. Structuring the coding strategy and behavioral part was key compared to just winging it. Also for behavioral questions, adding metrics and data to the outputs was really beneficial.

###### Top tip for others?

Do lots of mock interviews for system design and coding interviews. Honestly, mock interviews for behavioral didn't help me as much. I thought of a lot of cross questions that could be asked for behavioral so that is super important too. Also don't lie in the behavioral at all. You might think you can get away with it, chances are you won't since the bar raisers and other interviewers are experienced interviewers and they'll catch you straight away.

###### What surprised you?

Behavioral interview was tough because the interviewer wanted me to say more details for the situation and the result and also the atmosphere was a bit under pressure so I stuttered so much.

###### How did you prepare?

Coding: solved LeetCode top 65 questions more than 3 times with timer and I tried to emulate the real situation on Coderpad(didn't start with code stub, but started by defining the function signature by myself). Also, you'd be better watching all the videos for variants on CodingWithMinmer youtube channel. System Design: Practice all the well-known questions with Excalidraw with timer. Do as many mock interviews as possible. You can use Hello Interview, but also free peer-to-peer mock interview platforms as well. Follow Hello Interview delivery framework, but you have to make sure that you understand all the details and knowledge behind the solution Evan and Stefan suggests, so you should also study technical concepts by yourself as well and ChatGPT works really well by asking all the followup questions to dive deep into a technical concept.

###### Top tip for others?

I've done 10 mock interviews on Hello Interview and it really really helped. I think if I didn't, I couldn't have passed the onsite. I've done 5 system designs, 4 behaviorals, and 1 coding. I've got 3 No Hires and 7 Hires. It not only gave me a lot of confidence for the real interview, but also let me focus on the way of assessment for Meta efficiently.

Practicing all of the system design exercises consistently the week+ beforehand. This was my weakest area previously and afterwards it was my most confident.

###### Top tip for others?

Be prepared for variations on everything. Even the system design question, the interviewer was primarily most interested on how to scale, and wanted to 'skip ahead' to it. Talk through everything even if it seems obvious to you.

The hellointerview guided practices were a life saver!

###### Top tip for others?

During system design interview, you should drive the conversation and keep the feedback loop to the minimum. Obviously ask for feedback after Functional requirements to contain the scope of the problem, but drive the high level design and deep dive by yourself. Talk about trade offs while designing key components instead of waiting for the interviewer to ask questions. Spend a little bit more time talking about APIs upfront.

###### What surprised you?

Common to popular believe, you don’t need a \*perfect\* set of coding rounds to pass. I struggled with one of my coding problems, but am convinced that I was passed through because I talked in depth about the solution at a high level and communicated clearly throughout the interview.

###### How did you prepare?

Mocks, mocks, mocks. Every single stage of your interview needs to be practiced with a live human being or you will struggle. This includes coding, SD, AND behavioral. Set timers and pursue feedback from both friends and professionals.

###### Top tip for others?

Don’t sweat every little mistake. You may fumble over words in one of your interviews — that’s okay. Talk through what you know and communicate clearly with your interviewers so they understand your thought process, experience, and knowledge.

###### What surprised you?

1\. How short time seems compared to real-life whether it is LLD, System Design or Leetcode. The time in interview is deadline so you should practice that. 2. Prepare 10+ stories Amazon loves LPs and definitely you don't want to come unprepared. 3. Interviewers do give hints, a big part of evaluation is how you receive and deal with feedback.

###### How did you prepare?

1\. Taking notes on everything. And spending the day before interview to review them one by one. 2. Using hello interview. I mean this is my first-time EVER doing a system design interview and I nailed it! 3. No matter how prepared you are there will still be questions that you won't recognize take a deep breath and think clearly. preparation doesn't mean "memorizing", it means "studying and processing" information. So be good at that. 4. Anyone telling you that preparation is a matter of X months are lying. Our brains are wired differently.

###### Top tip for others?

The earlier the better. You should have time to make mistakes and stumble upon first-time problems. Study earlier not just to crack interviews but to be a good software engineer. These topics need lots of time to digest.

###### Additional notes

Thanks Hello interview. I am truly looking forward to use it for learning for the rest of my subscription. I did know some of the topics but was lacking structure and that fact that you are the ONLY platform out there that teaches "framework for handling a design problem" is fascinating. Thanks for organizing my brain pathways!

###### How did you prepare?

Reviewing and practicing the AdClick problem helped me a lot with tackling their the System Design challenge.

###### Additional notes

My lessons learnt: 1. At senior levels and above, highlighting impacts and achievements is critical. I didn’t effectively articulate my technical contributions during the final behavioral interview. 2. Communication is a two-way process. Listening carefully before responding is essential. My enthusiasm while discussing microservice best practices led to a misunderstanding. 3. Be authentic and focus on your achievements and values. Ultimately, interviewers want to see the real you.

Interviewed in March 2025

###### What surprised you?

The culture interview is a mix of behavioral questions and philosophical questions around AGI around 3 themes: - How you work with others - What some of the societal impacts are around AI - Ensuring you’re onboard with prioritizing Anthropic's core values above profit. Also, the system design interview was formatted pretty differently from other companies. It’s much more structured – they feed you prepared questions one at a time, but these are roughly inline with the phases of the HelloInterview format. They don’t have a mobile or frontend specific sys design, but they don’t dive deeply into backend portions (eg CAP theorem) if you’re interviewing for mobile. Primarily it’s around API shape and data persistence as it pertains to the user’s experience.

###### How did you prepare?

Preparing stories I could talk through for behavioral questions for both the manager interview + culture interview.

###### Top tip for others?

You need to have a reason to want to work here that is not along the lines of “I want to work in AI” or “I see the profit potential of AI”. Spend some time going through the prep materials for the culture interview provided in the recruiting packet and think through some of the societal implications of AI (good or bad). Don’t over rehearse your answers as this comes off as inauthentic and recruiting warns this is a common failure mode. Also spend time thinking through past challenging work related situations and be able to discuss them (eg receiving negative feedback, working with others through conflict, etc).

###### Additional notes

I had a pleasant experience with all the interviewers.

How quickly time passed, especially when stuck in a problem.

###### How did you prepare?

Hello Interview was my only source of preparation for product architecture and it was more then enough. For coding, doing a ton of LC questions, making sure to get the answer before reviewing the correct one. Also, dividing time to make sure I prepared for all the different interviews.

###### Top tip for others?

Be open and communicative during your interviews, share your thought process out loud and discuss with the interviewer. Practice resolving coding and architecture/system design while talking out loud and explaining everything you're doing. This was crucial for me to pass.

###### Additional notes

Keeping an optimistic mindset and considering that the interviewer actively wanted me to succeed helped calm my nerves and perform well. Try to keep that in mind as you go through the loop!

###### What surprised you?

I wasn't surprised at all, Meta has a very good process to avoid any surprises, and I was well aware of all things that interviewers need to check. Kudos to them for the process

###### How did you prepare?

Even though I didn't pass specifically for system design, I believe that HelloInterview has valuable prepartion material. I just didn't have enough time to prepare.

###### Top tip for others?

Prepare first, then apply.

Interviewed in March 2025

###### What surprised you?

Something that surprised me was how much was focused on the initial design. I think my interviewer specifically wanted a very strong MVP before moving onto deep dives. Just something to be aware of that you might not get to "speed through" your first iteration of the system. You'll definitely need to call out potential issues beforehand, and even pull in things from your deep dives into the MVP to pass the interviewer's expectations.

###### How did you prepare?

Definitely watching the prep videos for system design. The videos were detailed and organized, making them easy to follow. Just as important however, was the ability to leave comments on the video and the quick turnaround time of the responses from y'all. Evan and Stefan's willingness to have actual conversations with their users is what gave me in-depth knowledge/direction to learn more.

###### Top tip for others?

Don't just watch/read the prep material, engage with it. Think deeply about the seemingly simple parts, and rush to get clarification on anything nebulous. Interviewers have a way of diving deep into what you're most shaky on! The deeper your understanding of simple concepts, the easier it is to handle any twists/turns in the interview.

Product architecture was more focused on client side interactions and API design than backend systems and scale.

###### Top tip for others?

Do leetcode top 100 for meta thoroughly. For product architecture hello interview is a great resource to get confident and build a structured method for answering the questions, but also watch some youtube videos for systems that talk more about product design than diving into backend components

###### What surprised you?

Even if you're not able to reach the optimal solutions during one of the coding questions, make sure to at least communicate and code a naive solution thoroughly. This can be enough to get you past the threshold if you did well on other coding interviews.

###### How did you prepare?

Mock interviews, both system design and behavioral. Also, ChatGPT can be really helpful to learn coding and system design questions as well as help craft responses to behavioral questions.

###### Top tip for others?

For Meta behaviorals, really focus on communicating that you're able to handle ambiguity and that you're able to influence without authority.

###### What surprised you?

The interviewer got into a few details about presigned urls that I was not prepared for: - How do you secure images in the blob storage from being seen by others? My answer: authenticate in the server and return presigned urls using the server permissions. - What if you need to return N presigned urls? My answer: I don't know if S3 provides a batch api for that, but we could limit the number of images returned using some strategy similar to pagination. - Do you think we could add a CDN in this case? My answer: only if the CDN supports some kind of authentication, we can't simply add the assets there and make them public. I think S3 and CDNs have proper features for these cases, but I don't know about them.

###### How did you prepare?

The delivery framework and using the guided practice.

###### Top tip for others?

Follow the delivery framework. Keep an eye on the watch to make sure you are moving at the proper pace, it's easy to get bogged down into details in some steps. Avoid over-engineering, stick to your requirements.

###### Additional notes

Uber shares a link for codesignal before the interview, I did a few exercises using their diagram tool before the interview which helped me get familiar with shortcuts, which features I had available, etc. If I hadn't done this before I would loose time during the interview.

###### What surprised you?

After designing the system using Kafka, Flink, and ClickHouse, the interviewer asked how I would solve the problem without using any of those technologies, building everything from scratch. He gave me a generic queue and a generic database. I responded that I would use consistent hashing to organize the workers in a consumer group, which would aggregate the data from the queue and write it to the database. The data would be partitioned by ad\_id

###### How did you prepare?

Watching the Hello Interview videos and practicing with their example system design questions was very valuable. I realized that Redis is a flexible technology that can be used to solve many types of problems. Because of that, I took a Redis course to practice each data structure and to feel more confident using Redis beyond just caching

Almost all the behavioral questions were followed-up with a "what would you do differently" or "If you could go back and do it again, what type of technology would you choose?"

###### What surprised you?

I didn’t expect the product architecture interview to focus so heavily on APIs. Unfortunately, I wasn't prepared for that.

###### How did you prepare?

For coding, I was doing Leetcode problems from the Meta’s top 100 list. Most of the actual questions were variations of them or had extra constraints. Coding with Minmer on YouTube has some of the variants. For system design, I mainly used Hello Interview, ChatGPT, and skimmed through Designing Data-Intensive Applications.

###### Top tip for others?

Unless you're an API specialist, it might be safer to opt for a more traditional system design interview. There's significantly more preparation material available for that format.

###### What surprised you?

Unlike Meta, questions also came from outside the top questions on leetcode for the company. In essence, Airbnb asks 1 hard problem per coding interview. It's not required to fully solve it, just to get close.

###### How did you prepare?

HelloInterview has been invaluable for my preparation for the system design interview. For behavioral, I recommend reading your answers to chatgpt. For coding, I used algomonster.

###### Top tip for others?

The system design interview was just the same as a Product Architecture at Meta, no real difference. Get familiar with all the standard problems. Be ready for difficult follow-up questions. You need to be able to make a good API. As for coding, also be very familiar with the standard problems for the company, pay for leetcode premium and filter on frequency.

###### Additional notes

Airbnb had way more focus on behavioral interviews. I had in total 1 system design, 2 coding, 3 behavioural.

PRACTICE system design. Keep using the tools on hellointerview to prepare for system design. The same questions in the problem breakdown were asked in the actual interview.

###### Top tip for others?

Doing a mock interview probably would have helped a lot. I wasn't able to due to time constraints.

###### Additional notes

It's tough. I prepared for a month and I feel like I barely succeeded.

Interviewed in February 2025

###### What surprised you?

I was surprised with the fact that my system design round interviewer had very little inputs. Post discussion of initial problem statement the only words from their side was "what else" throughout the interview. Be prepared to handle such situations. What I did was recall what I had learnt (all improvements in design done for each bottlenecks from my notes) and discussed that with interviewer.

###### How did you prepare?

I was able to do fine for most part of my high level design interview as per me. I had no experience of system design interview prior to this and used only hello interview for preparation. The questions in behavioral interview matched exactly with what I found here so I was ready with answers beforehand.

###### Top tip for others?

Practice DSA, focus on why particular approach is better than other instead of just arriving at answer. Focus on time and space complexity.

###### Additional notes

Although my design round was not up to the mark as per interviewer I was fairly confident and satisfied with my performance since I covered all aspects of it. So all the best to me for future interviews.

###### What surprised you?

The system design round went well , the hello interview really helped in this . But for coding it did not work out not because of lack of knowledge but due to nitpicking by the interviewer. May be for snowflake you cannot have typos in code

###### How did you prepare?

going through all the system design concepts

###### Top tip for others?

Before reading the system design questions try to prepare a hld and deep dive for the system by yourself in the practice section or pen it down

###### How did you prepare?

Working on Practice problems in HelloInterview greatly helps me prepare the System Design.

###### Top tip for others?

Maintain coding problem-solving fluency before interview (e.g. 0.5/1 hour per day). Spend most of the time for behavioral and system design preparation for higher level interview.

###### What surprised you?

Everyone was super friendly and seemed genuinely interested to be there

###### How did you prepare?

Prioritizing doing a thorough retrospective on your past experience and catering the message to what Meta is looking for. As an EM, don’t spend too much time prepping for the coding interview, just make sure to do a couple of basic two pointer, array and queue problems and you’ll be fine

###### Top tip for others?

Relax. The more you’re able to shift your mindset from “I can’t screw this up” to “this is a great challenge for me to learn from and maybe get a better job”, the better your overall performance will be during the interviews

###### What surprised you?

Some interviewers did a slightly tweak on the system design problem prompt, would completely expect a different solution.

###### How did you prepare?

Do 10+ mocks. Practice system design as much as if you are practicing leetcode coding problems.

###### Top tip for others?

1\. For behavior round, refine your story based on your real experience. At least for me, coming up with random stories and trying to recite didn't work. Dig into your own experience and come out with multiple angles will be helpful. And also, do mocks with your targeting company's (past) interviewer. 2. At the end of the world, I found system design is still another type of leetcoding work.

For Product Architecture Design round I started with HelloInterview model and was ready to cover most of the backend system including scale etc. but I was stopped and ask to focus on the Data Model out right when I defined the Entity and The API. So Had to spend a lot of time in the initial stage to come up with all the attributes and Response Structure for the API.

memorizing all the core concepts first, and then reading through all the examples of how to use those core concepts.

###### Top tip for others?

brute force memorize core concepts. Then study the hell out of the examples

Interviewed in February 2025

###### What surprised you?

I was surprised that at Meta, they provide valuable feedback even if you don’t pass the interview.

###### How did you prepare?

Mock interviews. I focused more on drilling technical skills. But it turned out that even if you don’t reach the optimal solution, the interviewer will often try to guide you toward it. And if you’re not under a lot of stress in that moment, you’re more likely to catch the hint. One of the best ways to manage your stress level is to do as many mock interviews as possible.

###### Top tip for others?

Listen to your interviewer. They’re not your enemy — they’re trying to help you pass the interview and reveal your strengths.

###### Additional notes

Pass as many mock interviews as possible. It gives you confidence, reduces stress, and helps you see the problem more clearly. Also, pay attention to what your interviewer says — they usually try to help you or clarify any ambiguities.

Brush up on skills used in day to day work—debugging in your IDE of choice, knowing how to make HTTP requests/process responses in the language of your choice—system design was perfect prep from Hello Interview, though the actual problem ended up being fairly easy.

###### Top tip for others?

A lot of people on Blind/Leetcode discuss/etc will say to use python or other languages that are not verbose, but I recommend whatever language you are most comfortable in/use the most for work. I did Java (which a lot of folks online recommend against) and the expectations for parts finished was lower. More emphasis on code quality and familiarity with the language.

Practice top 120 meta tagged coding questions and understand different approach & trade-offs Have 2-3 mock interview for system design beforehand Show your takeaway insights at the end for each bahavior questions to align the Meta culture pillars

###### What surprised you?

Some interviewers didn't seem engaged in the interview at all, while others asked way too many questions which made writing code difficult. Additionally, one of the interviewers kept asking about making the code "more efficient" which confused me since I knew the algorithms I was using were optimal, and it took some time to realize that they were really referring to micro optimizations of the code, e.g. if you have to loop through one of two dictionaries, loop through the smaller one.

The system design mocks really help you think on your feet and when you talk through your thoughts, they stick.

###### How did you prepare?

I feel one should prepare through all the system design questions on hellointerview, irrespective of your level. The blogs and videos do a great job of giving ideas to deep dive and display your competencies, breaking it down level wise. Doing mocks is like icing on the cake - helps a lot in identifying what parts can be refined, be it your pace, whiteboard maintainability, delivery, more/less depth coverage, etc. For coding, practice is the key. Reading through past experiences helps to get an idea of how actual round would go.

###### Top tip for others?

Amazon focuses a lot on their leadership principles. I would suggest preparing atleast 2 stories per leadership principle before hand (I personally had 10 stories, out of which some could be delivered in ways covering different leadership principles). Typically, you would be asked 2 leadership questions + followups per interview round.

###### What surprised you?

The interviewer time management was terrible, asked many unnecessary questions during the first problem and wasted the time for the second problem. I got the ideas for both problem very quickly and implemented the first one very quickly but due to the interviewer bad time management I did not have a chance to implement the second problem.

###### How did you prepare?

Practicing a lot.

###### Top tip for others?

Verify how many questions you are going to be asked during the interview and make sure to manage your time in case the interviewer was unexperienced.

###### Top tip for others?

Received strong feedback on design and behavioral. However, learnt that they also want candidates to be fast with coding and solve without any hints. I needed a hint for time complexity and didn't code complete the second question in the coding round where there were two questions.

###### What surprised you?

Did not use a whiteboard, it was all in a text editor. Also, the scale was to a single restaurant. This meant no horizontal scaling, so it got much more low level with the data structures and how it was working functionally.

###### How did you prepare?

Having a structured framework to go through allowed me to hit all the functional requirements in a timely fashion.

###### Top tip for others?

There will be times where your interviewer will ask a follow up question you might not know the optimal solution for. Walk through your thought process, give a solution. Explain what more you might have to address going forward, and keep moving. Confidence goes a long way here. Some people will waffle and waste a lot of time trying to find the perfect optimal solution and not get to the rest of the problem.

###### What surprised you?

The followup questions are the hard part about the system design. I failed the first product architecture interview because he drilled into like "how does your distributed lock work? isn't that a bad idea", but passed all other interviews, so I got a new system design interview which I passed after preparing dedicatedly for it for a week.

###### How did you prepare?

HelloInterview!! The Learn->System Design as well as the AI tool was pivotal in me passing the product architecture interview, which is where I was lacking. For the coding interview, just do the top problems for the company on leetcode, literally all questions I got was in the top 100 for Meta (for which I did all). I also recommend algomonster for learning the fundamental problem types, if you're not already familiar.

###### Top tip for others?

In a system design interview, don't just draw the boxes and lines, you need to be able to defend the decisions in the graph. Like, I had a "virtual waiting queue" in the graph for the ticket booking system (based on my memory of the hellointerview solution) which I couldn't explain sufficiently, and then I failed the interview. You must know what you're adding and why!!

###### Additional notes

The interactive AI system design tool on HelloInterview is a bit too kind. In truth, you fail if you don't have a good answer.

###### What surprised you?

Behavioral - I couldn't finish the stories I prepared for the behavioral interview, the interviewer interrupted and asked follow up questions and didn't let me finish it in the prepared STAR format. System design - interviewer didn't want, or even insisted that I will talk about concepts, never about a specific technology.

###### How did you prepare?

Coding: Neetcode 150 + Tagged questions Design: Hello interview

###### Top tip for others?

Design: I did TONS of preparation with the entire 23 problems (correct to this point of time) of Hello interview, and I took a mock session. Unfortunately , it is not enough. Hello interview did an amazing job, and I'm not saying it to complain or something, but to give an actual tip for candidates. What I suggest is that after you finish with Hello's problem set, go and look for more and more design questions over the internet. Behavioral: Generated stories appeared to be way to long for the interview, and the interviewer didn't want to let me finish telling them. So keep them very short! If he asks more on some aspect, be ready to deep dive on that. Also, do a mock interview in design. This interview should really not be underestimated. Coding: Neetcode 150 is amazing, if you have more time, do Leetcode premium and do company tagged.

###### What surprised you?

The real life interviewers can be very different personality-wise from the coaches. The coaches are friendly, upbeat and extrovert seeming, which makes sense considering the service they are providing. Pretty much all of my interviewers seemed like introverts, like myself. In some sense that was less intimidating. If you are short on time and need to prioritize I would not worry as much about coming off as polished and instead put more energy to studying the content. That being said, I was rejected and there was no feedback provided so I could totally be off-base.

###### What surprised you?

One of my coding rounds had 3 questions instead of 2. I’m not sure what caused it, lack of signal vs solving the first 2 questions too quickly.

###### How did you prepare?

Studying system design problems from this site. Coding interviews were easy to prep for using tagged questions off leetcode but before reading the design questions on hello interview it was difficult to know what I should focus my time and effort on studying to ensure I was able pass the design round.

###### Top tip for others?

Prepare for behavioral interview by putting together and practicing discussion about a few different projects you worked on. I suspect if I hadn’t don’t some practice ahead of time I would have been unable to give enough signal to pass this round!

###### What surprised you?

I think sometimes we forget the interviewers are human too and want to see you pass. I'd say good interviewers work with you to arrive at an answer and really try to hint you to success (e.g. for a bug, trying to explain why they still see that bug). So when I still passed after some bugs (but resolving it), I felt more grateful to those interviewers.

###### How did you prepare?

Having a routine to do LeetCode + system design. Approaching it with methodical rigor to ensure I'm making progress in my understanding. Practice and practice!

###### Top tip for others?

Do Meta-tagged questions on LeetCode. Get it from a friend/online or pay for premium! Also, practice and really commit to preparation.

###### Additional notes

It's difficult to balance studying/grinding for interviews with a full-time job. Make sure to try find a routine that works for you and commit to that. Iterate on the routine until you feel you are making progress smoothly.

###### How did you prepare?

Mock interview for system design and project retrospective was super helpful, because it was only my second system design and first project retrospective. Going on leetcode discuss and seeing past problems asked, as well as going through all the system design guides on hello interview was very helpful!

###### Top tip for others?

For system design, go through guides on hellointerview and make sure you understand common patterns. For technical project retrospective, make sure you know your project inside out, including metrics - that was something I had to prepare

Interviewed in January 2025

###### What surprised you?

Most of the interviewers were really friendly and easygoing. I also made an effort to stay relaxed and treat each one like a peer, which helped manage my anxiety and think more clearly. During the behavioral interview, I could tell one interviewer was really digging into my answers. He kept pushing for more details, almost like he wasn’t fully convinced. Since everything I shared was true, I stayed calm and just added more context to clarify my points.

###### How did you prepare?

The behavioral mock interview with Stefan was by far the most valuable part of my preparation strategy. It highlighted just how unprepared I was to clearly communicate the impact of my work in behavioral interviews. Over the course of our session, Evan helped me understand how to convey my contributions in cross-team collaborations, organizational dynamics, and their business impact, even in situations filled with ambiguity. This training transformed my approach and built my confidence in articulating my professional journey effectively.

###### Top tip for others?

Check Hello Interview’s recent system design questions by frequency. They helped me prioritize the problems I reviewed repeatedly while connecting the dots with specific areas for deep dives based on my experience. Don’t underestimate the importance of the behavioral interview. I knew it would be my Achilles’ heel, so I had to rewire my thinking to become a better storyteller. I had great experiences, but I needed to communicate them effectively. Don’t undersell your stories—they are valuable and far more interesting than you might think!

Interviewed in January 2025

###### What surprised you?

The random reason Meta can reject you for. I was mainly interview by Directors and other than one high performing direction ( judging from his experience and how quickly he had grown ) it felt they were looking for one particular signal and that was proactive leadership but they would present questions as a reacting to something. So just be careful on ensuring when they play back to you a story you have processes in place. I don't think many m2 always react but there are bad managers out there. So i was suprised because i had passed the M2 process before with the same process, thinking and ways of working.

###### How did you prepare?

I rocked the system design and Hello interview was critical in this. It allows to practice in structured way which just builds your problem solving toolset. It is missing the time keeping element and requirements gathering which is crucial too. I did use a coach which helped me practice the two elements.

###### Top tip for others?

IF you are being interviewed by directors then its good to get a mock session with a director as they know how they are responding to candidates. Prep using Hello interview before doing mocks it makes it super easy to practice.

Interviewed in January 2025

###### What surprised you?

I mostly wasn't surprised by anything, as I had done extensive research beforehand. The one thing that did surprise me though was that I was asked a hard question during the phone screen (most people online say Meta doesn't ask hard), and how fast the coding interview goes by.

###### How did you prepare?

Timing myself while practicing leetcode and system design. This was the most valuable thing because it helped me get much faster.

###### Top tip for others?

For leetcode especially, if you don't know the solution within a few minutes, I would just look it up. I didn't really find any value in trying to come up with a solution on my own, especially if you are just starting out with leetcode prep. I legit did not feel like I could solve anything until maybe about 100 problems in. After that, I felt like I was finally able to see patterns in questions and was able to tackle problems on my own.

###### Additional notes

Look up the interviewers beforehand on LinkedIn and ask them questions related to their career or anything interesting they may have posted there. I did this with all my interviewers, and I felt they were all happy to be asked something more personal.

###### What surprised you?

Unfortunately, my product design interview was a bit unorganized from the get-go. My interviewer was scheduled for 45 min but my interviewer incorrectly assumed our interview ended at the 30 minute mark, so I was rushed through the beginning steps, which may have led to my "no" decision.

###### How did you prepare?

HelloInterview's system design breakdowns were invaluable for my preparation. In my career, I haven't really worked on a distributed system for a big tech company, so I was unfamiliar with more common system design concepts. I also scheduled multiple system design mock interviews, which allowed me to become familiar and comfortable with a system design interview.

###### Top tip for others?

I had my interview before guided practice was released, and I spent countless hours going through common system design problems in 35 min, writing down my solutions on paper and talking through my thought process as if I were in an interview.

Interviewers want you to succeed, because it's easier for them to write about someone that succeeds than someone who fails. So, listen careful, they really want to help you.

###### How did you prepare?

Doing a bunch mock interviews and having a routine helped me prepare both in terms of reducing my stress during the actual interview as well as keeping me focused.

###### Top tip for others?

You're capable, just need to crunch hours into practice!

###### Additional notes

Consider paying someone to do salary negotiation. This is a skill most engineer do not have but is super valuable.

###### What surprised you?

I had to 2 product architecture interviews, where 1 was API-focused and not following the hello interview format at all. I was caught off guard there and had to improvise the whole way through. Luckily I was able to speak mostly from experience and passed the interview.

###### How did you prepare?

The Hello Interview answer format for product architecture interviews (FR, NFR, Entities, HLD, ...) was super invaluable in time management. The mock interview I had also helped me focus on fixing my weakness

###### Top tip for others?

For leetcode, know the solutions to as many questions as possible. Expect to have to modify them as you'll most likely get modified versions of the questions. Knowing the baseline solutions lets you save energy and focus on what's different + explaining. For product architecture, have a format that you always follow and know how long each section should take. Time your practices and actual interviews.

###### How did you prepare?

For System Design - have a clear and practiced framework for answering questions. Hello Interview provides a great one (start with reqs, describe API, broad design, deep dives), but the most important thing is to be able to efficiently apply that system to any problem. Practice it, repeatedly. Pace a room and talk through key problems over and over.

###### Top tip for others?

Time yourself. Always practice with a clock.

###### How did you prepare?

A mock interview helps a lot to prepare yourself to appropriately utilize 35 minutes to cover all aspects of system design. Also, leave some time for the interviewer to ask any questions they have. In between, nudge them if they have any questions. This assures us that we are going in the right direction and not missing what he would like us to cover.

###### Top tip for others?

Give detailed justification for all the components you use in your system design. This will help build high confidence with the interviewer and get him engaged.

systems design was good - but there's variations - asked me to build a music recommender but had very very loose starting requirements and un prepared. Need more practice when the interview is typing in the requirements unprepared and unsure what the requirements are. Be prepared to coach up to people junior more junior than you interviewing you

###### What surprised you?

Nothing was surprising as it was a standing mid-level SDE interview

###### How did you prepare?

HelloInterview was great for my System Design interview preparation, as I had never given one before. One thing I did in my preparation strategy was not spend too much time on a coding question. If I didn't come up with an answer in 30 minutes, I would look at the solution and try to understand the logic and how they approached the question.

###### Top tip for others?

Understanding the topic is essential rather than mugging up the solution. I recommend reading about the technology, watching videos, and even trying it on your local machine to get an idea. This will help a lot in System Design interviews.

###### Additional notes

I did a mock interview for Meta at HelloInterview. Even though I didn't get the offer from Meta, I took that experience to my Microsoft interview. I am happy to share that I got the offer and started this week.

###### What surprised you?

My second system design interview felt more hands-off than I expected as an E4. It felt like I was leading the discussion. I'm not sure if this was positive or negative (I asked my recruiter for specific interview feedback).

###### How did you prepare?

Definitely doing my mock interviews with Hello Interview. I learned my weaknesses were being slow to generate requirements and move to design and then overcomplicating things. Even in my first system design for Meta (which was a training round), it felt like my interviewer was trying to move me along as quick as possible to do the design even though I was well under 10 minutes before starting the design. My second interview felt like I had a lot more control of the pace. By this time, I had also learned more about technical feasibility of things and limitations i.e how to handle streaming in real time, the fact that a scheduled map-reduce cron job can't run in real-time so I felt a lot more confident in these interviews.

###### Top tip for others?

If you can, pay for the mock interviews from Hello Interview. The interviewers will often give you different ideas from what is taught in the videos. One of my interviewers were extremely generous with his time and went above and beyond with his guidance. If you can't, the next best thing I can think of is testing yourself doing designs and using either the AI tool from Hello Interview or some other one like chat GPT to critique your design. I personally prefer going start to finish to lay out my entire design and then explain it and then see what the gaps are and fix it. I found that sometimes when I went piece by piece with the hello interview tool, my perfectionism kept kicking in and I wanted to redo things until I said the right things. I think that's to do to learn, but when it comes to testing I think speed is the most important thing since you only get 35 minutes in a real interview.

###### Additional notes

I think system and design and behavioral should be where most candidates focus their studying on Meta. How to succeed on their coding portion is not really a secret. It hasn't changed a bit in the last 5 years in my experience. I did get asked one question that I hadn't done before - it actually showed on the 30 day tagged in the last minute - but because of my practice I was able to find a solution in 15 minutes. For behavioral, AI tools are again great for coming up with structures for stories to common questions.

###### How did you prepare?

Microsoft has no defined interview process. I'd suggest reading the role description closely, and if you get a chance to talk to the hiring manager before the interview, ask them what the team will be working on. For me, a new cache was a clear goal for the team, and a lot of my interview questions circled around caches, so my prep on that paid off.

Leetcode. I was already doing meta tagged so it helped me out.

###### Top tip for others?

I like to think that when someone is starting out they should not jump to solutions. Its important to first understand the concept. even if one solves the problem using brute force, the learning from there is invaluable. Having said that of course don't spend days on the same problem because sometimes it might be a lack of understanding of a particular concept.

As usual, the questions had small twists to LC questions. I discussed my approach before coding both, and interviewer agreed, and on top of that they still asked me to implement some different approaches (same TC/SC) after completing the question the first time.

Communication is key here -- I got both questions correct, but the recruiter feedback was that my communication through my problem solving was the most impressive.

###### What surprised you?

I struggled a bit on my second leetcode interview (LC 1152). I recognized the problem, but the "cleaner" solution was using a built in library func. that I was unfamiliar with. I eventually got what seemed like a working solution, but expected that my confusion and time taken to understand the problem would fail me here. In the end I think it helped that I spent so much time clarifying the question, because it showed how I could deal with uncertainty and confusion.

###### How did you prepare?

Prepping Amazon LP questions was key. There are so many they can ask you and your examples are bound to overlap. By writing out plenty of stories ahead of time, you'll have options to think towards when your first examples were already used.

###### Top tip for others?

Take notes during the power day to keep track of what LPs you are being asked. At times the questions may sound similar, but there are subtle differences. This will help minimize reuse of any stories.

The interviewer threw a curveball and asked for a separate strategy for handling the part where we use S3 events to indicate multipart upload completion. I guess it would help if you had a few different options up your sleeve on how to design the same feature.

###### How did you prepare?

The structured framework definitely helped. The feedback I got from the recruiter was that I did pretty well in the System Design part.

###### Top tip for others?

Focus on behavioral stories and prep. The soft skills interview was something I didnt do great on and I wish I had picked better stories to convey soft skills.

###### Additional notes

Behavioral prep and mock should definitely be a big part of interview preparation. Overall I was told that the team wanted to consider me for another role once the cool-down period was over so they likely didnt get enough Staff signals. Another feedback from the recruiter was : I have quite a bit of experience with live streaming and snap does on-demand streaming. So they had a hard time judging the technical aspects.

###### What surprised you?

My systems design went much more in-depth than I was expecting. I was prepared for high-level concepts like in the mock interviews, but my interviewer wanted to focus a lot more on nitty-gritty. For example, I was asked to describe how quad trees and geohashing work, and I also had to write some SQL queries. I almost felt like I couldn't show off all that I had prepared for large scale systems because the question was too narrow in scope--question asked was a significantly pared down "Design Yelp" that only had a single API endpoint.

###### How did you prepare?

The AI mock systems design interviews were terrific. I honestly felt overprepared for my systems design interview.

###### Top tip for others?

Meta almost only asks questions from their recently asked questions list. Prepping leetcode is a great idea, but you can work smarter by drilling the top frequency questions. I practiced the top frequency questions multiple times rather than doing random LC questions, and it paid off.

###### What surprised you?

Questions were not hard. I was expecting some complex graph algorithm. Luckily questions were easy and interviewers were very helpful and collaborative

###### How did you prepare?

Leetcode and Mock Interviews. Especially for system design interviews, I would say mock interviews were the deciding factor and I learned 5 weeks worth of reading in an hour mock interview. I literally started preparing for system design interview 1 month before my interview date and I was very knew. Even though I knew different components in a system I didn't quite fully understand why a certain component was there.

###### Top tip for others?

Set out at least a month to grind leetcode questions. They're only a handful amount of problem solving techniques and you will find the best technique for each question if you know each technique inside out and can fully implement it from scratch. Focus on fundamentals and watch each question crack like glass.

###### Additional notes

I know it's a cliche but focusing and trying to fully comprehend what the interviewer is trying to hint at is a big skill. Sometimes the hints will require a full restructure of our solution and if we're too deep into the solution we will not even pick up on the hints. Learn to do input validation and clarifying questions before you start coding. Propose a solution and discuss with interviewer before directly coding.

###### How did you prepare?

Study system design questions and to have the approach in mind. Clarify the requirements, starting with a high level solution and then dive deep into different components.

###### Top tip for others?

Don't try to over complicate the design. Start with a high level design which is working and then try to optimise different components. If you decide to use a specific technology (like Casandra, S3, etc), try to explain a little why did you chose that tech and how it will help you.

###### What surprised you?

Some interviewers for System design want you to sketch out the data schemas and do calculations. Just describing the data flow is not enough. Need further in depth knowledge.

###### How did you prepare?

System design videos were nice and informative but need more real life examples or mock interviews where we talk through a design. Need more E4 tips and tricks, stuff that is essential to remember and work on and what's passing in your standards. Sometimes in depth E4 knowledge isn't enough for system design rounds.

###### Top tip for others?

Read some tech blogs on how stuff works and is implemented. There's always a curve ball with these system design interviews. Also do Grind 75 + Meta tagged.

###### Additional notes

Probably prepare 1-2 months for system and do several mocks. It is more beneficial than just watching the videos.

Interviewed in December 2024

###### What surprised you?

Not sure if anything in particular was a surprise. I was very happy that I studied the top 60 tagged Meta questions and all known variants since there was a whole coding round that consisting of 2 of the top asked questions- it made my prep feel really worth it. Alas, it was a total surprise to be asked a recursive backtracking question. I didn't prep for the topic since it wasn't a top asked topic. Honestly, it was so difficult that I didn't mind not knowing it. But it definitely hurt knowing that that round was 100% of the reason I didn't get an offer.

###### How did you prepare?

Hello Interview + Leetcode tagged questions! Hello interview is the absolute best source for system design and behavioral prep. Leetcode is just leetcode.

###### Top tip for others?

Use Hello Interview to prep. You don't need to know more than the top 60 tagged Leetcode questions since after that number, the themes are pretty much the same. You'll be able to recognize the patterns by then.

###### Additional notes

I'm so bummed that one guy at Meta woke up and thought "let me ask a wicked hard question that we rarely ask". I crushed every other round- even the first half of that one. But the fact that one crazy hard question was my demise totally sucks. I honestly wouldn't have prepped differently. Just the luck of the draw.

I was pleasantly surprised at how well the delivery framework worked for the interview. My interviewer was very comfortable with me driving and only course-corrected slightly once or twice.

###### How did you prepare?

Practice makes perfect. The practice problems, especially for internalizing the delivery framework, were massively helpful.

###### Top tip for others?

Start with understanding the fundamentals deeply, and then start practicing aggressively.

###### How did you prepare?

I believe the mock interviews with hellointerview were critical to my receiving an offer. I needed to do multiple mock interviews with different coaches to surface issues, as my performance in the mock interviews was inconsistent. Hellointerview's guided practice tool for system design was also helpful as a mock interview substitute.

###### Top tip for others?

For system design, read Designing Data Intensive Applications if you can, it gives you a solid foundation.

I had a structure in mind and it was largely based on what I saw here on Hello Interview. I was going to cover the functional requirements first by giving a simple solution and then dive deep by optimizing the solutions. The interviewer was not interested in that approach and told me to just jump into deep dives right away. The interviewer was also very interested in having the SQL vs NoSQL debate.

###### What surprised you?

How relatively challenging I found the behavioral interview round, which I used to consider my strongest skillset.

###### How did you prepare?

Definitely the System Design practice here at Hello Interview. Followed closely by the deep dives on the relevant technologies.

###### Top tip for others?

Prepare and \*practice\* your behavioral interview stories! The Hello Interview story builders are great, but practicing those concise stories is really important to get the highlights across to the interviewer quickly. They can always ask questions to follow up on what they're interested in after you've delivered the bottom line up front (BLUF).

###### Additional notes

Make sure you actively gather scale metrics at the beginning and call out that you'll use them for napkin math later if needed. Communicate proactively what meta-strategies you're going to use, e.g.: "I'm going to come back to this later, because there's a lot about it that is possibly interesting, but lets get the basic functionalities done first"

As someone that didn't have any system design experience, hellointerview was a god send. Will definitely recommend this to friends as part of interview prepping :)

###### Top tip for others?

Practice speaking your thoughts out loud when prepping for all your interviews, will make it easier to actually talk during the actual interview.

###### Additional notes

HelloInterview helped me get a good result for system design round in Meta. Really love the resource! Although I wasn't able to get Meta, I was able to land another great opportunity and HelloInterview prep also helped me with that system design interview as well! Just want you guys to know you guys are doing great and I'm very thankful this platform exists!

The mock interviews. The feedback from the interviewers is nice, but more importantly, they tell me what the interviewers actually look for. There are many ways one could do the interview as a candidate, but knowing the signals and flow the interviewers want makes it straightforward.

###### Top tip for others?

Grind Leetcode top 100-150 for the last 6 months. Know every question like the back of your hand.

Interviewed in September 2024

###### How did you prepare?

For Staff level role you need 3 parts to maximize your chances: 1. Previous relevant experience, it's hard to pass the interview at staff if you don't have it. 2. Put in the work to prepare (e.g., time yourself doing system design and do it until you get within the allotted time, same for LeetCode, prepare stories for behavioral). 3. The mock interviews are providing customized feedback on aspects you may not see yourself. I think they're extremely valuable, for system design I would do 2-3 mocks with different interviewers to get more perspectives (I did 3 myself), for behavioral 1 mock interview is enough I would think (but it depends on how far you are, maybe 2 mocks would work better for you), coding 1 round should be enough to get some tips (considering you're practicing LeetCode on your own).

###### Top tip for others?

If you're targeting Staff level and booking mock interviews, you want Staff+ level interviewers from the company you're targeting. That's more expensive, but at higher levels you really need that extra edge.

###### Additional notes

I think for LeetCode you can focus on mediums top 100 for the company you're targeting, then time yourself and try to aim for up to 20 mins. If you take more time, put the problem in a list to retry and do it again in 2-3 days (in between you can do other problems). If you're consistent here solving problems, you've got it.

hellointerview mock interviews! The interviewers were articulate and gave amazing debriefs. They each came with fresh perspectives, which helped me focus on different weak areas. I highly recommend.

It is extremely tough. Sometimes, you can do it all correctly and not get a pass. I failed more than I passed interviews, stick in there. It's a numbers game on top of knowledge and communication.

Interviewed in June 2024

###### What surprised you?

1\. Even though I opted for Product Architecture rounds, interviewer treated them as Sys Design rounds. When I am elaborating on APIs during first round , interviewer stopped and asked me to focus on backend architecture. For second round , I checked if I should focus on scaling and architecture for which interviewer said yes. 2. Coding - Once interviewers shared questions, I solved it on my notebook silently and wrote actual code after 10-15min (because thats how I practiced from past several months). Even though both questions are completed without any bugs in time, interviewers did not seem impressed.

###### How did you prepare?

Make sure to ace coding rounds. This is because, I got a sense that Sys design / Product Arch are highly subjective.

###### Top tip for others?

1\. Prepare previous meta medium questions from leetcode. 2. Behavioral - prepare answer bank for various scenarios 3. SysDes/ProdArch - Hello Interview along with Modern Sys Design course in educative.io.

###### Additional notes

Meta has specific way of 'presenting' coding rounds - once we get the question, candidate should call out boundary conditions/seek clarification, start coding soon (within 5min) and talk your thought process while coding, once coding is complete call out at least 4 or 5 test cases and walk the interviewer through the code using most relevant test case.
