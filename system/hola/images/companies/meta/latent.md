Not a reasoning 
GRPO rollouts

Plug it in to Claude Code
Sparse and cheap

Diff reasoning
Take out think tokens

Gwen beats all of these

OpenBench help verify
Opus is expensive to benchmark

Evolve from static
Dynamic adapt
Train model that is good for tool use
Train on environment

Good citations for data gen
4 papers for tooluse

Model 1 trillion parameter

- MuonClip better than adamw
  - scaling this optimize
  - clip off attention weight update

Rephrasing pipeline
- LLM faith
- Chunk-wise
  - divide into segments
  - rephrase 
  - stick it back together
- check synthetic alignment

1. train original for 10 epochs
2. rephrase it and train for 
3. data augmentation
