###### Design a data ingestion system

System Design

Mid-level

Test engineers will run several tests with multiple drones. The data from these tests will then need to be uploaded to a system where they can be queried by other teams to analyze the data. Data will include frequent (1-20hz) sensor readings like location, battery health, radar tracks, etc. as well as video.

###### Design a leasing system

System Design

Mid-level

There are five dedicated environments where engineers can reserve for running their tests. The tests range from 20 minutes long to 3 hours long, such as stress tests, chaos tests, and load tests. There should be only one test running per environment at the same time, and engineers should be able to reserve an environment at a future time. One key thing to consider is to properly handle messy failures, such as test jobs hanging or environments being bogged down. You can assume there's a blackbox test framework that you can use that interacts with each environment.
